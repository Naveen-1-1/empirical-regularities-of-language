        "Shannon borrowed the concept of entropy from statistical physics to develop _information theory_, focused on encoding and compressing messages. A few years later, in 1950, he applied information theory to analyze human predictive abilityâ€”in other words, the entropy of the human language model. You can read the original article, [Prediction and Entropy of Printed English](https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Shannon1950.pdf), for more details.\n",

Recall that Zipf's law states that a word's rank (from the most common word at rank 1 on down) to its frequency is approximately a constant, i.e., $r \\cdot f = k$. Equivalently, we can divide both sides by the total number of tokens $N$ to get $r \\cdot P_r = c$, where $c = k/N$ and $P_r = f/N$ is the _relative frequency_ of word $r$.\n",

APRIL\\n\\n II. MAY\\n\\nIII. JUNE\\n\\n IV. JULY\\n\\n V. AUGUST\\n\\n VI. SEPTEMBER\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\n\\nAPRIL\\n\\nThe Deacons were at supper. In the middle of the table was a small,\\nappealing tulip plant, looking as anything would look whose sun was a\\ngas jet. This gas jet was high above the table and flared, with a sound.\\n\\n\\\"Better turn down the gas jest a little,\\\" Mr. Deacon said, and stretched\\nup to do so. He made this joke almost every night. He seldom spoke as a\\nman speaks who has something to say, but as a man who makes something to\\nsay.\\n\\n\\\"Well, what have we on the festive board to-night?\\\" he questioned,\\neyeing it. \\\"Festive\\\" was his favourite adjective. \\\"Beautiful,\\\" too. In\\nOctober he might be heard asking: \\\"Where's my beautiful fall coat?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We have creamed salmon,\\\" replied Mrs. Deacon gently. \\\"On toast,\\\" she\\nadded, with a scrupulous regard for the whole truth. Why she should say\\nthis so gently no one can tell. She says everything gently. Her \\\"Could\\nyou leave me another bottle of milk this morning?\\\" would wring a\\nmilkman's heart.\\n\\n\\\"Well, now, let us see,\\\" said Mr. Deacon, and attacked the principal\\ndish benignly. \\\"_Let_ us see,\\\" he added, as he served.\\n\\n\\\"I don't want any,\\\" said Monona.\\n\\nThe child Monona was seated upon a book and a cushion, so that her\\nlittle triangle of nose rose adultly above her plate. Her remark\\nproduced precisely the effect for which she had passionately hoped.\\n\\n\\\"_What's_ this?\\\" cried Mr. Deacon. \\\"_No_ salmon?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Monona, inflected up, chin pertly pointed. She felt her\\npower, discarded her \\\"sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh now, Pet!\\\" from Mrs. Deacon, on three notes. \\\"You liked it before.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't want any,\\\" said Monona, in precisely her original tone.\\n\\n\\\"Just a little? A very little?\\\" Mr. Deacon persuaded, spoon dripping;\\n\\nThe child Monona made her lips thin and straight and shook her head\\nuntil her straight hair flapped in her eyes on either side. Mr. Deacon's\\neyes anxiously consulted his wife's eyes. What is this? Their progeny\\nwill not eat? What can be supplied?\\n\\n\\\"Some bread and milk!\\\" cried Mrs. Deacon brightly, exploding on \\\"bread.\\\"\\nOne wondered how she thought of it.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Monona, inflection up, chin the same. She was affecting\\nindifference to this scene, in which her soul delighted. She twisted\\nher head, bit her lips unconcernedly, and turned her eyes to the remote.\\n\\nThere emerged from the fringe of things, where she perpetually hovered,\\nMrs. Deacon's older sister, Lulu Bett, who was \\\"making her home with\\nus.\\\" And that was precisely the case. _They_ were not making her a\\nhome, goodness knows. Lulu was the family beast of burden.\\n\\n\\\"Can't I make her a little milk toast?\\\" she asked Mrs. Deacon.\\n\\nMrs. Deacon hesitated, not with compunction at accepting Lulu's offer,\\nnot diplomatically to lure Monona. But she hesitated habitually, by\\nnature, as another is by nature vivacious or brunette.\\n\\n\\\"Yes!\\\" shouted the child Monona.\\n\\nThe tension relaxed. Mrs. Deacon assented. Lulu went to the kitchen. Mr.\\nDeacon served on. Something of this scene was enacted every day. For\\nMonona the drama never lost its zest. It never occurred to the others to\\nlet her sit without eating, once, as a cure-all. The Deacons were\\ndevoted parents and the child Monona was delicate. She had a white,\\ngrave face, white hair, white eyebrows, white lashes. She was sullen,\\nanaemic. They let her wear rings. She \\\"toed in.\\\" The poor child was the\\nlate birth of a late marriage and the principal joy which she had\\nprovided them thus far was the pleased reflection that they had produced\\nher at all.\\n\\n\\\"Where's your mother, Ina?\\\" Mr. Deacon inquired. \\\"Isn't she coming to\\nher supper?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tantrim,\\\" said Mrs. Deacon, softly.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, ho,\\\" said he, and said no more.\\n\\nThe temper of Mrs. Bett, who also lived with them, had days of high\\nvibration when she absented herself from the table as a kind of\\nself-indulgence, and no one could persuade her to food. \\\"Tantrims,\\\" they\\ncalled these occasions.\\n\\n\\\"Baked potatoes,\\\" said Mr. Deacon. \\\"That's good--that's good. The baked\\npotato contains more nourishment than potatoes prepared in any other\\nway. The nourishment is next to the skin. Roasting retains it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's what I always think,\\\" said his wife pleasantly.\\n\\nFor fifteen years they had agreed about this.\\n\\nThey ate, in the indecent silence of first savouring food. A delicate\\ncrunching of crust, an odour of baked-potato shells, the slip and touch\\nof the silver.\\n\\n\\\"Num, num, nummy-num!\\\" sang the child Monona loudly, and was hushed by\\nboth parents in simultaneous exclamation which rivalled this lyric\\noutburst. They were alone at table. Di, daughter of a wife early lost to\\nMr. Deacon, was not there. Di was hardly ever there. She was at that\\nage. That age, in Warbleton.\\n\\nA clock struck the half hour.\\n\\n\\\"It's curious,\\\" Mr. Deacon observed, \\\"how that clock loses. It must be\\nfully quarter to.\\\" He consulted his watch. \\\"It is quarter to!\\\" he\\nexclaimed with satisfaction. \\\"I'm pretty good at guessing time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've noticed that!\\\" cried his Ina.\\n\\n\\\"Last night, it was only twenty-three to, when the half hour struck,\\\" he\\nreminded her.\\n\\n\\\"Twenty-one, I thought.\\\" She was tentative, regarded him with arched\\neyebrows, mastication suspended.\\n\\nThis point was never to be settled. The colloquy was interrupted by the\\nchild Monona, whining for her toast. And the doorbell rang.\\n\\n\\\"Dear me!\\\" said Mr. Deacon. \\\"What can anybody be thinking of to call\\njust at meal-time?\\\"\\n\\nHe trod the hall, flung open the street door. Mrs. Deacon listened.\\nLulu, coming in with the toast, was warned to silence by an uplifted\\nfinger. She deposited the toast, tiptoed to her chair. A withered baked\\npotato and cold creamed salmon were on her plate. The child Monona ate\\nwith shocking appreciation. Nothing could be made of the voices in the\\nhall. But Mrs. Bett's door was heard softly to unlatch. She, too, was\\nlistening.\\n\\nA ripple of excitement was caused in the dining-room when Mr. Deacon was\\ndivined to usher some one to the parlour. Mr. Deacon would speak with\\nthis visitor in a few moments, and now returned to his table. It was\\nnotable how slight a thing would give him a sense of self-importance.\\nNow he felt himself a man of affairs, could not even have a quiet supper\\nwith his family without the outside world demanding him. He waved his\\nhand to indicate it was nothing which they would know anything about,\\nresumed his seat, served himself to a second spoon of salmon and\\nremarked, \\\"More roast duck, anybody?\\\" in a loud voice and with a slow\\nwink at his wife. That lady at first looked blank, as she always did in\\nthe presence of any humour couched with the least indirection, and then\\ndrew back her chin and caught her lower lip in her gold-filled teeth.\\nThis was her conjugal rebuking.\\n\\nSwedenborg always uses \\\"conjugial.\\\" And really this sounds more married.\\nIt should be used with reference to the Deacons. No one was ever more\\nmarried than they--at least than Mr. Deacon. He made little conjugal\\njokes in the presence of Lulu who, now completely unnerved by the habit,\\nsuspected them where they did not exist, feared lurking _entendre_ in\\nthe most innocent comments, and became more tense every hour of her\\nlife.\\n\\nAnd now the eye of the master of the house fell for the first time upon\\nthe yellow tulip in the centre of his table.\\n\\n\\\"Well, _well_!\\\" he said. \\\"What's this?\\\"\\n\\nIna Deacon produced, fleetly, an unlooked-for dimple.\\n\\n\\\"Have you been buying flowers?\\\" the master inquired.\\n\\n\\\"Ask Lulu,\\\" said Mrs. Deacon.\\n\\nHe turned his attention full upon Lulu.\\n\\n\\\"Suitors?\\\" he inquired, and his lips left their places to form a sort of\\nruff about the word.\\n\\nLulu flushed, and her eyes and their very brows appealed.\\n\\n\\\"It was a quarter,\\\" she said. \\\"There'll be five flowers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You _bought_ it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. There'll be five--that's a nickel apiece.\\\"\\n\\nHis tone was as methodical as if he had been talking about the bread.\\n\\n\\\"Yet we give you a home on the supposition that you have no money to\\nspend, even for the necessities.\\\"\\n\\nHis voice, without resonance, cleft air, thought, spirit, and even\\nflesh.\\n\\nMrs. Deacon, indeterminately feeling her guilt in having let loose the\\ndogs of her husband upon Lulu, interposed: \\\"Well, but, Herbert--Lulu\\nisn't strong enough to work. What's the use....\\\"\\n\\nShe dwindled. For years the fiction had been sustained that Lulu, the\\nfamily beast of burden, was not strong enough to work anywhere else.\\n\\n\\\"The justice business--\\\" said Dwight Herbert Deacon--he was a justice of\\nthe peace--\\\"and the dental profession--\\\" he was also a dentist--\\\"do not\\nwarrant the purchase of spring flowers in my home.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, but, Herbert--\\\" It was his wife again.\\n\\n\\\"No more,\\\" he cried briefly, with a slight bend of his head. \\\"Lulu\\nmeant no harm,\\\" he added, and smiled at Lulu.\\n\\nThere was a moment's silence into which Monona injected a loud \\\"Num,\\nnum, num-my-num,\\\" as if she were the burden of an Elizabethan lyric. She\\nseemed to close the incident. But the burden was cut off untimely. There\\nwas, her father reminded her portentously, company in the parlour.\\n\\n\\\"When the bell rang, I was so afraid something had happened to Di,\\\" said\\nIna sighing.\\n\\n\\\"Let's see,\\\" said Di's father. \\\"Where is little daughter to-night?\\\"\\n\\nHe must have known that she was at Jenny Plow's at a tea party, for at\\nnoon they had talked of nothing else; but this was his way. And Ina\\nplayed his game, always. She informed him, dutifully.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, _ho_,\\\" said he, absently. How could he be expected to keep his mind\\non these domestic trifles.\\n\\n\\\"We told you that this noon,\\\" said Lulu.\\n\\nHe frowned, disregarded her. Lulu had no delicacy.\\n\\n\\\"How much is salmon the can now?\\\" he inquired abruptly--this was one of\\nhis forms of speech, the can, the pound, the cord.\\n\\nHis partner supplied this information with admirable promptness. Large\\nsize, small size, present price, former price--she had them all.\\n\\n\\\"Dear me,\\\" said Mr. Deacon. \\\"That is very nearly salmoney, isn't it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Herbert!\\\" his Ina admonished, in gentle, gentle reproach. Mr. Deacon\\npunned, organically. In talk he often fell silent and then asked some\\nquestion, schemed to permit his vice to flourish. Mrs. Deacon's return\\nwas always automatic: \\\"_Her_bert!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Whose Bert?\\\" he said to this. \\\"I thought I was your Bert.\\\"\\n\\nShe shook her little head. \\\"You are a case,\\\" she told him. He beamed\\nupon her. It was his intention to be a case.\\n\\nLulu ventured in upon this pleasantry, and cleared her throat. She was\\nnot hoarse, but she was always clearing her throat.\\n\\n\\\"The butter is about all gone,\\\" she observed. \\\"Shall I wait for the\\nbutter-woman or get some creamery?\\\"\\n\\nMr. Deacon now felt his little jocularities lost before a wall of the\\nmatter of fact. He was not pleased. He saw himself as the light of his\\nhome, bringer of brightness, lightener of dull hours. It was a pretty\\nr\\u00f4le. He insisted upon it. To maintain it intact, it was necessary to\\nturn upon their sister with concentrated irritation.\\n\\n\\\"Kindly settle these matters without bringing them to my attention at\\nmeal-time,\\\" he said icily.\\n\\nLulu flushed and was silent. She was an olive woman, once handsome, now\\nwith flat, bluish shadows under her wistful eyes. And if only she would\\nlook at her brother Herbert and say something. But she looked in her\\nplate.\\n\\n\\\"I want some honey,\\\" shouted the child, Monona.\\n\\n\\\"There isn't any, Pet,\\\" said Lulu.\\n\\n\\\"I want some,\\\" said Monona, eyeing her stonily. But she found that her\\nhair-ribbon could be pulled forward to meet her lips, and she embarked\\non the biting of an end. Lulu departed for some sauce and cake. It was\\napple sauce. Mr. Deacon remarked that the apples were almost as good as\\nif he had stolen them. He was giving the impression that he was an\\nirrepressible fellow. He was eating very slowly. It added pleasantly to\\nhis sense of importance to feel that some one, there in the parlour, was\\nwaiting his motion.\\n\\nAt length they rose. Monona flung herself upon her father. He put her\\naside firmly, every inch the father. No, no. Father was occupied now.\\nMrs. Deacon coaxed her away. Monona encircled her mother's waist, lifted\\nher own feet from the floor and hung upon her. \\\"She's such an active\\nchild,\\\" Lulu ventured brightly.\\n\\n\\\"Not unduly active, I think,\\\" her brother-in-law observed.\\n\\nHe turned upon Lulu his bright smile, lifted his eyebrows, dropped his\\nlids, stood for a moment contemplating the yellow tulip, and so left the\\nroom.\\n\\nLulu cleared the table. Mrs. Deacon essayed to wind the clock. Well now.\\nDid Herbert say it was twenty-three to-night when it struck the half\\nhour and twenty-one last night, or twenty-one to-night and last night\\ntwenty-three? She talked of it as they cleared the table, but Lulu did\\nnot talk.\\n\\n\\\"Can't you remember?\\\" Mrs. Deacon said at last. \\\"I should think you\\nmight be useful.\\\"\\n\\nLulu was lifting the yellow tulip to set it on the sill. She changed her\\nmind. She took the plant to the wood-shed and tumbled it with force upon\\nthe chip-pile.\\n\\nThe dining-room table was laid for breakfast. The two women brought\\ntheir work and sat there. The child Monona hung miserably about,\\nwatching the clock. Right or wrong, she was put to bed by it. She had\\neight minutes more--seven--six--five--\\n\\nLulu laid down her sewing and left the room. She went to the wood-shed,\\ngroped about in the dark, found the stalk of the one tulip flower in its\\nheap on the chip-pile. The tulip she fastened in her gown on her flat\\nchest.\\n\\nOutside were to be seen the early stars. It is said that if our sun were\\nas near to Arcturus as we are near to our sun, the great Arcturus would\\nburn our sun to nothingness.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nIn the Deacons' parlour sat Bobby Larkin, eighteen. He was in pain all\\nover. He was come on an errand which civilisation has contrived to make\\nan ordeal.\\n\\nBefore him on the table stood a photograph of Diana Deacon, also\\neighteen. He hated her with passion. At school she mocked him, aped\\nhim, whispered about him, tortured him. For two years he had hated her.\\nNights he fell asleep planning to build a great house and engage her as\\nits servant.\\n\\nYet, as he waited, he could not keep his eyes from this photograph. It\\nwas Di at her curliest, at her fluffiest, Di conscious of her bracelet,\\nDi smiling. Bobby gazed, his basic aversion to her hard-pressed by a\\nmost reluctant pleasure. He hoped that he would not see her, and he\\nlistened for her voice.\\n\\nMr. Deacon descended upon him with an air carried from his supper hour,\\nbland, dispensing. Well! Let us have it. \\\"What did you wish to see me\\nabout?\\\"--with a use of the past tense as connoting something of\\nindirection and hence of delicacy--a nicety customary, yet unconscious.\\nBobby had arrived in his best clothes and with an air of such formality\\nthat Mr. Deacon had instinctively suspected him of wanting to join the\\nchurch, and, to treat the time with due solemnity, had put him in the\\nparlour until he could attend at leisure.\\n\\nConfronted thus by Di's father, the speech which Bobby had planned\\ndeserted him.\\n\\n\\\"I thought if you would give me a job,\\\" he said defencelessly.\\n\\n\\\"So that's it!\\\" Mr. Deacon, who always awaited but a touch to be either\\nirritable or facetious, inclined now to be facetious. \\\"Filling teeth?\\\"\\nhe would know. \\\"Marrying folks, then?\\\" Assistant justice or assistant\\ndentist--which?\\n\\nBobby blushed. No, no, but in that big building of Mr. Deacon's where\\nhis office was, wasn't there something ... It faded from him, sounded\\nridiculous. Of course there was nothing. He saw it now.\\n\\nThere was nothing. Mr. Deacon confirmed him. But Mr. Deacon had an idea.\\nHold on, he said--hold on. The grass. Would Bobby consider taking charge\\nof the grass? Though Mr. Deacon was of the type which cuts its own\\ngrass and glories in its vigour and its energy, yet in the time after\\nthat which he called \\\"dental hours\\\" Mr. Deacon wished to work in his\\ngarden. His grass, growing in late April rains, would need attention\\nearly next month ... he owned two lots--\\\"of course property _is_ a\\nburden.\\\" If Bobby would care to keep the grass down and raked ... Bobby\\nwould care, accepted this business opportunity, figures and all, thanked\\nMr. Deacon with earnestness. Bobby's aversion to Di, it seemed, should\\nnot stand in the way of his advancement.\\n\\n\\\"Then that is checked off,\\\" said Mr. Deacon heartily.\\n\\nBobby wavered toward the door, emerged on the porch, and ran almost upon\\nDi returning from her tea-party at Jenny Plow's.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Bobby! You came to see me?\\\"\\n\\nShe was as fluffy, as curly, as smiling as her picture. She was carrying\\npink, gauzy favours and a spear of flowers. Undeniably in her voice\\nthere was pleasure. Her glance was startled but already complacent. She\\npaused on the steps, a lovely figure.\\n\\nBut one would say that nothing but the truth dwelt in Bobby.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, hullo,\\\" said he. \\\"No. I came to see your father.\\\"\\n\\nHe marched by her. His hair stuck up at the back. His coat was hunched\\nabout his shoulders. His insufficient nose, abundant, loose-lipped mouth\\nand brown eyes were completely expressionless. He marched by her without\\na glance.\\n\\nShe flushed with vexation. Mr. Deacon, as one would expect, laughed\\nloudly, took the situation in his elephantine grasp and pawed at it.\\n\\n\\\"Mamma! Mamma! What do you s'pose? Di thought she had a beau----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, papa!\\\" said Di. \\\"Why, I just hate Bobby Larkin and the whole\\n_school_ knows it.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Deacon returned to the dining-room, humming in his throat. He\\nentered upon a pretty scene.\\n\\nHis Ina was darning. Four minutes of grace remaining to the child\\nMonona, she was spinning on one toe with some Bacchanalian idea of\\nmaking the most of the present. Di dominated, her ruffles, her blue\\nhose, her bracelet, her ring.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, and mamma,\\\" she said, \\\"the sweetest party and the dearest supper\\nand the darlingest decorations and the gorgeousest----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Grammar, grammar,\\\" spoke Dwight Herbert Deacon. He was not sure what he\\nmeant, but the good fellow felt some violence done somewhere or other.\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Di positively, \\\"they _were_. Papa, see my favour.\\\"\\n\\nShe showed him a sugar dove, and he clucked at it.\\n\\nIna glanced at them fondly, her face assuming its loveliest light. She\\nwas often ridiculous, but always she was the happy wife and mother, and\\nher r\\u00f4le reduced her individual absurdities at least to its own.\\n\\nThe door to the bedroom now opened and Mrs. Bett appeared.\\n\\n\\\"Well, mother!\\\" cried Herbert, the \\\"well\\\" curving like an arm, the\\n\\\"mother\\\" descending like a brisk slap. \\\"Hungry _now?_\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Bett was hungry now. She had emerged intending to pass through the\\nroom without speaking and find food in the pantry. By obscure processes\\nher son-in-law's tone inhibited all this.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" she said. \\\"I'm not hungry.\\\"\\n\\nNow that she was there, she seemed uncertain what to do. She looked from\\none to another a bit hopelessly, somehow foiled in her dignity. She\\nbrushed at her skirt, the veins of her long, wrinkled hands catching an\\nintenser blue from the dark cloth. She put her hair behind her ears.\\n\\n\\\"We put a potato in the oven for you,\\\" said Ina. She had never learned\\nquite how to treat these periodic refusals of her mother to eat, but\\nshe never had ceased to resent them.\\n\\n\\\"No, thank you,\\\" said Mrs. Bett. Evidently she rather enjoyed the\\nsituation, creating for herself a spot-light much in the manner of\\nMonona.\\n\\n\\\"Mother,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"let me make you some toast and tea.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Bett turned her gentle, bloodless face toward her daughter, and her\\neyes warmed.\\n\\n\\\"After a little, maybe,\\\" she said. \\\"I think I'll run over to see Grandma\\nGates now,\\\" she added, and went toward the door.\\n\\n\\\"Tell her,\\\" cried Dwight, \\\"tell her she's my best girl.\\\"\\n\\nGrandma Gates was a rheumatic cripple who lived next door, and whenever\\nthe Deacons or Mrs. Bett were angry or hurt or wished to escape the\\nhouse for some reason, they stalked over to Grandma Gates--in lieu of,\\nsay, slamming a door. These visits radiated an almost daily friendliness\\nwhich lifted and tempered the old invalid's lot and life.\\n\\nDi flashed out at the door again, on some trivial permission.\\n\\n\\\"A good many of mamma's stitches in that dress to keep clean,\\\" Ina\\ncalled after.\\n\\n\\\"Early, darling, early!\\\" her father reminded her. A faint regurgitation\\nof his was somehow invested with the paternal.\\n\\n\\\"What's this?\\\" cried Dwight Herbert Deacon abruptly.\\n\\nOn the clock shelf lay a letter.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Dwight!\\\" Ina was all compunction. \\\"It came this morning. I forgot.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I forgot it too! And I laid it up there.\\\" Lulu was eager for her share\\nof the blame.\\n\\n\\\"Isn't it understood that my mail can't wait like this?\\\"\\n\\nDwight's sense of importance was now being fed in gulps.\\n\\n\\\"I know. I'm awfully sorry,\\\" Lulu said, \\\"but you hardly ever get a\\nletter----\\\"\\n\\nThis might have made things worse, but it provided Dwight with a\\ngreater importance.\\n\\n\\\"Of course, pressing matter goes to my office,\\\" he admitted it. \\\"Still,\\nmy mail should have more careful----\\\"\\n\\nHe read, frowning. He replaced the letter, and they hung upon his\\nmotions as he tapped the envelope and regarded them.\\n\\n\\\"Now!\\\" said he. \\\"What do you think I have to tell you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Something nice,\\\" Ina was sure.\\n\\n\\\"Something surprising,\\\" Dwight said portentously.\\n\\n\\\"But, Dwight--is it _nice?_\\\" from his Ina.\\n\\n\\\"That depends. I like it. So'll Lulu.\\\" He leered at her. \\\"It's company.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Dwight,\\\" said Ina. \\\"Who?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"From Oregon,\\\" he said, toying with his suspense.\\n\\n\\\"Your brother!\\\" cried Ina. \\\"Is he coming?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. Ninian's coming, so he says.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ninian!\\\" cried Ina again. She was excited, round-eyed, her moist lips\\nparted. Dwight's brother Ninian. How long was it? Nineteen years. South\\nAmerica, Central America, Mexico, Panama \\\"and all.\\\" When was he coming\\nand what was he coming for?\\n\\n\\\"To see me,\\\" said Dwight. \\\"To meet you. Some day next week. He don't\\nknow what a charmer Lulu is, or he'd come quicker.\\\"\\n\\nLulu flushed terribly. Not from the implication. But from the knowledge\\nthat she was not a charmer.\\n\\nThe clock struck. The child Monona uttered a cutting shriek. Herbert's\\neyes flew not only to the child but to his wife. What was this, was\\ntheir progeny hurt?\\n\\n\\\"Bedtime,\\\" his wife elucidated, and added: \\\"Lulu, will you take her to\\nbed? I'm pretty tired.\\\"\\n\\nLulu rose and took Monona by the hand, the child hanging back and\\nshaking her straight hair in an unconvincing negative.\\n\\nAs they crossed the room, Dwight Herbert Deacon, strolling about and\\nsnapping his fingers, halted and cried out sharply:\\n\\n\\\"Lulu. One moment!\\\"\\n\\nHe approached her. A finger was extended, his lips were parted, on his\\nforehead was a frown.\\n\\n\\\"You _picked_ the flower on the plant?\\\" he asked incredulously.\\n\\nLulu made no reply. But the child Monona felt herself lifted and borne\\nto the stairway and the door was shut with violence. On the dark\\nstairway Lulu's arms closed about her in an embrace which left her\\nbreathless and squeaking. And yet Lulu was not really fond of the child\\nMonona, either. This was a discharge of emotion akin, say, to slamming\\nthe door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\n\\nMAY\\n\\nLulu was dusting the parlour. The parlour was rarely used, but every\\nmorning it was dusted. By Lulu.\\n\\nShe dusted the black walnut centre table which was of Ina's choosing,\\nand looked like Ina, shining, complacent, abundantly curved. The leather\\nrocker, too, looked like Ina, brown, plumply upholstered, tipping back a\\nbit. Really, the davenport looked like Ina, for its chintz pattern\\nseemed to bear a design of lifted eyebrows and arch, reproachful eyes.\\n\\nLulu dusted the upright piano, and that was like Dwight--in a perpetual\\nattitude of rearing back, with paws out, playful, but capable, too, of\\nroaring a ready bass.\\n\\nAnd the black fireplace--there was Mrs. Bett to the life. Colourless,\\nfireless, and with a dust of ashes.\\n\\nIn the midst of all was Lulu herself reflected in the narrow pier\\nglass, bodiless-looking in her blue gingham gown, but somehow alive.\\nNatural.\\n\\nThis pier glass Lulu approached with expectation, not because of herself\\nbut because of the photograph on its low marble shelf. A large\\nphotograph on a little shelf-easel. A photograph of a man with evident\\neyes, evident lips, evident cheeks--and each of the six were rounded and\\nconvex. You could construct the rest of him. Down there under the glass\\nyou could imagine him extending, rounded and convex, with plump hands\\nand curly thumbs and snug clothes. It was Ninian Deacon, Dwight's\\nbrother.\\n\\nEvery day since his coming had been announced Lulu, dusting the parlour,\\nhad seen the photograph looking at her with its eyes somehow new. Or\\nwere her own eyes new? She dusted this photograph with a difference,\\nlifted, dusted, set it back, less as a process than as an experience. As\\nshe dusted the mirror and saw his trim semblance over against her own\\nbodiless reflection, she hurried away. But the eyes of the picture\\nfollowed her, and she liked it.\\n\\nShe dusted the south window-sill and saw Bobby Larkin come round the\\nhouse and go to the wood-shed for the lawn mower. She heard the smooth\\nblur of the cutter. Not six times had Bobby traversed the lawn when Lulu\\nsaw Di emerge from the house. Di had been caring for her canary and she\\ncarried her bird-bath and went to the well, and Lulu divined that Di had\\ndeliberately disregarded the handy kitchen taps. Lulu dusted the south\\nwindow and watched, and in her watching was no quality of spying or of\\ncriticism. Nor did she watch wistfully. Rather, she looked out on\\nsomething in which she had never shared, could not by any chance imagine\\nherself sharing.\\n\\nThe south windows were open. Airs of May bore the soft talking.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Bobby, will you pump while I hold this?\\\" And again: \\\"Now wait till\\nI rinse.\\\" And again: \\\"You needn't be so glum\\\"--the village salutation\\nsignifying kindly attention.\\n\\nBobby now first spoke: \\\"Who's glum?\\\" he countered gloomily.\\n\\nThe iron of those days when she had laughed at him was deep within him,\\nand this she now divined, and said absently:\\n\\n\\\"I used to think you were pretty nice. But I don't like you any more.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, you used to!\\\" Bobby repeated derisively. \\\"Is that why you made fun\\nof me all the time?\\\"\\n\\nAt this Di coloured and tapped her foot on the well-curb. He seemed to\\nhave her now, and enjoyed his triumph. But Di looked up at him shyly and\\nlooked down. \\\"I had to,\\\" she admitted. \\\"They were all teasing me about\\nyou.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They were?\\\" This was a new thought to him. Teasing her about him, were\\nthey? He straightened. \\\"Huh!\\\" he said, in magnificent evasion.\\n\\n\\\"I had to make them stop, so I teased you. I--I never wanted to.\\\" Again\\nthe upward look.\\n\\n\\\"Well!\\\" Bobby stared at her. \\\"I never thought it was anything like\\nthat.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course you didn't.\\\" She tossed back her bright hair, met his eyes\\nfull. \\\"And you never came where I could tell you. I wanted to tell you.\\\"\\n\\nShe ran into the house.\\n\\nLulu lowered her eyes. It was as if she had witnessed the exercise of\\nsome secret gift, had seen a cocoon open or an egg hatch. She was\\nthinking:\\n\\n\\\"How easy she done it. Got him right over. But _how_ did she do that?\\\"\\n\\nDusting the Dwight-like piano, Lulu looked over-shoulder, with a manner\\nof speculation, at the photograph of Ninian.\\n\\nBobby mowed and pondered. The magnificent conceit of the male in his\\nunderstanding of the female character was sufficiently developed to\\ncause him to welcome the improvisation which he had just heard. Perhaps\\nthat was the way it had been. Of course that was the way it had been.\\nWhat a fool he had been not to understand. He cast his eyes repeatedly\\ntoward the house. He managed to make the job last over so that he could\\nreturn in the afternoon. He was not conscious of planning this, but it\\nwas in some manner contrived for him by forces of his own with which he\\nseemed to be co\\u00f6perating without his conscious will. Continually he\\nglanced toward the house.\\n\\nThese glances Lulu saw. She was a woman of thirty-four and Di and Bobby\\nwere eighteen, but Lulu felt for them no adult indulgence. She felt that\\nsweetness of attention which we bestow upon May robins. She felt more.\\n\\nShe cut a fresh cake, filled a plate, called to Di, saying: \\\"Take some\\nout to that Bobby Larkin, why don't you?\\\"\\n\\nIt was Lulu's way of participating. It was her vicarious thrill.\\n\\nAfter supper Dwight and Ina took their books and departed to the\\nChautauqua Circle. To these meetings Lulu never went. The reason seemed\\nto be that she never went anywhere.\\n\\nWhen they were gone Lulu felt an instant liberation. She turned\\naimlessly to the garden and dug round things with her finger. And she\\nthought about the brightness of that Chautauqua scene to which Ina and\\nDwight had gone. Lulu thought about such gatherings in somewhat the way\\nthat a futurist receives the subjects of his art--forms not vague, but\\nheightened to intolerable definiteness, acute colour, and always\\nmotion--motion as an integral part of the desirable. But a factor of all\\nwas that Lulu herself was the participant, not the onlooker. The\\nperfection of her dream was not impaired by any longing. She had her\\ndream as a saint her sense of heaven.\\n\\n\\\"Lulie!\\\" her mother called. \\\"You come out of that damp.\\\"\\n\\nShe obeyed, as she had obeyed that voice all her life. But she took one\\nlast look down the dim street. She had not known it, but superimposed on\\nher Chautauqua thoughts had been her faint hope that it would be\\nto-night, while she was in the garden alone, that Ninian Deacon would\\narrive. And she had on her wool chally, her coral beads, her cameo\\npin....\\n\\nShe went into the lighted dining-room. Monona was in bed. Di was not\\nthere. Mrs. Bett was in Dwight Herbert's leather chair and she lolled at\\nher ease. It was strange to see this woman, usually so erect and tense,\\nnow actually lolling, as if lolling were the positive, the vital, and\\nher ordinary rigidity a negation of her. In some corresponding orgy of\\nleisure and liberation, Lulu sat down with no needle.\\n\\n\\\"Inie ought to make over her delaine,\\\" Mrs. Bett comfortably began. They\\ntalked of this, devised a mode, recalled other delaines. \\\"Dear, dear,\\\"\\nsaid Mrs. Bett, \\\"I had on a delaine when I met your father.\\\" She\\ndescribed it. Both women talked freely, with animation. They were\\nindividuals and alive. To the two pallid beings accessory to the\\nDeacons' presence, Mrs. Bett and her daughter Lulu now bore no\\nrelationship. They emerged, had opinions, contradicted, their eyes were\\nbright.\\n\\nToward nine o'clock Mrs. Bett announced that she thought she should have\\na lunch. This was debauchery. She brought in bread-and-butter, and a\\ndish of cold canned peas. She was committing all the excesses that she\\nknew--offering opinions, laughing, eating. It was to be seen that this\\nwoman had an immense store of vitality, perpetually submerged.\\n\\nWhen she had eaten she grew sleepy--rather cross at the last and\\ninclined to hold up her sister's excellencies to Lulu; and, at Lulu's\\ndefence, lifted an ancient weapon.\\n\\n\\\"What's the use of finding fault with Inie? Where'd you been if she\\nhadn't married?\\\"\\n\\nLulu said nothing.\\n\\n\\\"What say?\\\" Mrs. Bett demanded shrilly. She was enjoying it.\\n\\nLulu said no more. After a long time:\\n\\n\\\"You always was jealous of Inie,\\\" said Mrs. Bett, and went to her bed.\\n\\nAs soon as her mother's door had closed, Lulu took the lamp from its\\nbracket, stretching up her long body and her long arms until her skirt\\nlifted to show her really slim and pretty feet. Lulu's feet gave news of\\nsome other Lulu, but slightly incarnate. Perhaps, so far, incarnate only\\nin her feet and her long hair.\\n\\nShe took the lamp to the parlour and stood before the photograph of\\nNinian Deacon, and looked her fill. She did not admire the photograph,\\nbut she wanted to look at it. The house was still, there was no\\npossibility of interruption. The occasion became sensation, which she\\nmade no effort to quench. She held a rendezvous with she knew not what.\\n\\nIn the early hours of the next afternoon with the sun shining across\\nthe threshold, Lulu was paring something at the kitchen table. Mrs. Bett\\nwas asleep. (\\\"I don't blame you a bit, mother,\\\" Lulu had said, as her\\nmother named the intention.) Ina was asleep. (But Ina always took off\\nthe curse by calling it her \\\"si-esta,\\\" long _i_.) Monona was playing\\nwith a neighbour's child--you heard their shrill yet lovely laughter as\\nthey obeyed the adult law that motion is pleasure. Di was not there.\\n\\nA man came round the house and stood tying a puppy to the porch post. A\\nlong shadow fell through the west doorway, the puppy whined.\\n\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" said this man. \\\"I didn't mean to arrive at the back door, but\\nsince I'm here--\\\"\\n\\nHe lifted a suitcase to the porch, entered, and filled the kitchen.\\n\\n\\\"It's Ina, isn't it?\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"I'm her sister,\\\" said Lulu, and understood that he was here at last.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I'm Bert's brother,\\\" said Ninian. \\\"So I can come in, can't I?\\\"\\n\\nHe did so, turned round like a dog before his chair and sat down\\nheavily, forcing his fingers through heavy, upspringing brown hair.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes,\\\" said Lulu. \\\"I'll call Ina. She's asleep.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't call her, then,\\\" said Ninian. \\\"Let's you and I get acquainted.\\\"\\n\\nHe said it absently, hardly looking at her.\\n\\n\\\"I'll get the pup a drink if you can spare me a basin,\\\" he added.\\n\\nLulu brought the basin, and while he went to the dog she ran tiptoeing\\nto the dining-room china closet and brought a cut-glass tumbler, as\\nheavy, as ungainly as a stone crock. This she filled with milk.\\n\\n\\\"I thought maybe ...\\\" said she, and offered it.\\n\\n\\\"Thank _you_!\\\" said Ninian, and drained it. \\\"Making pies, as I live,\\\" he\\nobserved, and brought his chair nearer to the table. \\\"I didn't know Ina\\nhad a sister,\\\" he went on. \\\"I remember now Bert said he had two of her\\nrelatives----\\\"\\n\\nLulu flushed and glanced at him pitifully.\\n\\n\\\"He has,\\\" she said. \\\"It's my mother and me. But we do quite a good deal\\nof the work.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll bet you do,\\\" said Ninian, and did not perceive that anything had\\nbeen violated. \\\"What's your name?\\\" he bethought.\\n\\nShe was in an immense and obscure excitement. Her manner was serene, her\\nhands as they went on with the peeling did not tremble; her replies were\\ngiven with sufficient quiet. But she told him her name as one tells\\nsomething of another and more remote creature. She felt as one may feel\\nin catastrophe--no sharp understanding but merely the sense that the\\nthing cannot possibly be happening.\\n\\n\\\"You folks expect me?\\\" he went on.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes,\\\" she cried, almost with vehemence. \\\"Why, we've looked for you\\nevery day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"'See,\\\" he said, \\\"how long have they been married?\\\"\\n\\nLulu flushed as she answered: \\\"Fifteen years.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And a year before that the first one died--and two years they were\\nmarried,\\\" he computed. \\\"I never met that one. Then it's close to twenty\\nyears since Bert and I have seen each other.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How awful,\\\" Lulu said, and flushed again.\\n\\n\\\"Why?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To be that long away from your folks.\\\"\\n\\nSuddenly she found herself facing this honestly, as if the immensity of\\nher present experience were clarifying her understanding: Would it be so\\nawful to be away from Bert and Monona and Di--yes, and Ina, for twenty\\nyears?\\n\\n\\\"You think that?\\\" he laughed. \\\"A man don't know what he's like till he's\\nroamed around on his own.\\\" He liked the sound of it. \\\"Roamed around on\\nhis own,\\\" he repeated, and laughed again. \\\"Course a woman don't know\\nthat.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why don't she?\\\" asked Lulu. She balanced a pie on her hand and carved\\nthe crust. She was stupefied to hear her own question. \\\"Why don't she?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maybe she does. Do you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Lulu.\\n\\n\\\"Good enough!\\\" He applauded noiselessly, with fat hands. His diamond\\nring sparkled, his even white teeth flashed. \\\"I've had twenty years of\\ngalloping about,\\\" he informed her, unable, after all, to transfer his\\ninterests from himself to her.\\n\\n\\\"Where?\\\" she asked, although she knew.\\n\\n\\\"South America. Central America. Mexico. Panama.\\\" He searched his\\nmemory. \\\"Colombo,\\\" he superadded.\\n\\n\\\"My!\\\" said Lulu. She had probably never in her life had the least desire\\nto see any of these places. She did not want to see them now. But she\\nwanted passionately to meet her companion's mind.\\n\\n\\\"It's the life,\\\" he informed her.\\n\\n\\\"Must be,\\\" Lulu breathed. \\\"I----\\\" she tried, and gave it up.\\n\\n\\\"Where you been mostly?\\\" he asked at last.\\n\\nBy this unprecedented interest in her doings she was thrown into a\\npassion of excitement.\\n\\n\\\"Here,\\\" she said. \\\"I've always been here. Fifteen years with Ina. Before\\nthat we lived in the country.\\\"\\n\\nHe listened sympathetically now, his head well on one side. He watched\\nher veined hands pinch at the pies. \\\"Poor old girl,\\\" he was thinking.\\n\\n\\\"Is it Miss Lulu Bett?\\\" he abruptly inquired. \\\"Or Mrs.?\\\"\\n\\nLulu flushed in anguish.\\n\\n\\\"Miss,\\\" she said low, as one who confesses the extremity of failure.\\nThen from unplumbed depths another Lulu abruptly spoke up. \\\"From\\nchoice,\\\" she said.\\n\\nHe shouted with laughter.\\n\\n\\\"You bet! Oh, you bet!\\\" he cried. \\\"Never doubted it.\\\" He made his palms\\ntaut and drummed on the table. \\\"Say!\\\" he said.\\n\\nLulu glowed, quickened, smiled. Her face was another face.\\n\\n\\\"Which kind of a Mr. are you?\\\" she heard herself ask, and his shoutings\\nredoubled. Well! Who would have thought it of her?\\n\\n\\\"Never give myself away,\\\" he assured her. \\\"Say, by George, I never\\nthought of that before! There's no telling whether a man's married or\\nnot, by his name!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It don't matter,\\\" said Lulu.\\n\\n\\\"Why not?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not so many people want to know.\\\"\\n\\nAgain he laughed. This laughter was intoxicating to Lulu. No one ever\\nlaughed at what she said save Herbert, who laughed at _her_. \\\"Go it, old\\ngirl!\\\" Ninian was thinking, but this did not appear.\\n\\nThe child Monona now arrived, banging the front gate and hurling herself\\nround the house on the board walk, catching the toe of one foot in the\\nheel of the other and blundering forward, head down, her short, straight\\nhair flapping over her face. She landed flat-footed on the porch. She\\nbegan to speak, using a ridiculous perversion of words, scarcely\\narticulate, then in vogue in her group. And,\\n\\n\\\"Whose dog?\\\" she shrieked.\\n\\nNinian looked over his shoulder, held out his hand, finished something\\nthat he was saying to Lulu. Monona came to him readily enough, staring,\\nloose-lipped.\\n\\n\\\"I'll bet I'm your uncle,\\\" said Ninian.\\n\\nRelationship being her highest known form of romance, Monona was\\nthrilled by this intelligence.\\n\\n\\\"Give us a kiss,\\\" said Ninian, finding in the plural some vague\\nmitigation for some vague offence.\\n\\nMonona, looking silly, complied. And her uncle said my stars, such a\\ngreat big tall girl--they would have to put a board on her head.\\n\\n\\\"What's that?\\\" inquired Monona. She had spied his great diamond ring.\\n\\n\\\"This,\\\" said her uncle, \\\"was brought to me by Santa Claus, who keeps a\\njewellery shop in heaven.\\\"\\n\\nThe precision and speed of his improvisation revealed him. He had twenty\\nother diamonds like this one. He kept them for those Sundays when the\\nsun comes up in the west. Of course--often! Some day he was going to\\nmelt a diamond and eat it. Then you sparkled all over in the dark, ever\\nafter. Another diamond he was going to plant. They say----He did it all\\ngravely, absorbedly. About it he was as conscienceless as a savage. This\\nwas no fancy spun to pleasure a child. This was like lying, for its own\\nsake.\\n\\nHe went on talking with Lulu, and now again he was the tease, the\\nbraggart, the unbridled, unmodified male.\\n\\nMonona stood in the circle of his arm. The little being was attentive,\\nsoftened, subdued. Some pretty, faint light visited her. In her\\nlistening look, she showed herself a charming child.\\n\\n\\\"It strikes me,\\\" said Ninian to Lulu, \\\"that you're going to do something\\nmighty interesting before you die.\\\"\\n\\nIt was the clear conversational impulse, born of the need to keep\\nsomething going, but Lulu was all faith.\\n\\nShe closed the oven door on her pies and stood brushing flour from her\\nfingers. He was looking away from her, and she looked at him. He was\\ncompletely like his picture. She felt as if she were looking at his\\npicture and she was abashed and turned away.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I hope so,\\\" she said, which had certainly never been true, for\\nher old formless dreams were no intention--nothing but a mush of\\ndiscontent. \\\"I hope I can do something that's nice before I quit,\\\" she\\nsaid. Nor was this hope now independently true, but only this surprising\\nlonging to appear interesting in his eyes. To dance before him. \\\"What\\nwould the folks think of me, going on so?\\\" she suddenly said. Her mild\\nsense of disloyalty was delicious. So was his understanding glance.\\n\\n\\\"You're the stuff,\\\" he remarked absently.\\n\\nShe laughed happily.\\n\\nThe door opened. Ina appeared.\\n\\n\\\"Well!\\\" said Ina. It was her remotest tone. She took this man to be a\\npedlar, beheld her child in his clasp, made a quick, forward step, chin\\nlifted. She had time for a very javelin of a look at Lulu.\\n\\n\\\"Hello!\\\" said Ninian. He had the one formula. \\\"I believe I'm your\\nhusband's brother. Ain't this Ina?\\\"\\n\\nIt had not crossed the mind of Lulu to present him.\\n\\nBeautiful it was to see Ina relax, soften, warm, transform, humanise. It\\ngave one hope for the whole species.\\n\\n\\\"Ninian!\\\" she cried. She lent a faint impression of the double _e_ to\\nthe initial vowel. She slurred the rest, until the _y_ sound squinted\\nin. Not Neenyun, but nearly Neenyun.\\n\\nHe kissed her.\\n\\n\\\"Since Dwight isn't here!\\\" she cried, and shook her finger at him. Ina's\\nconception of hostess-ship was definite: A volley of questions--was his\\ntrain on time? He had found the house all right? Of course! Any one\\ncould direct him, she should hope. And he hadn't seen Dwight? She must\\ntelephone him. But then she arrested herself with a sharp, curved fling\\nof her starched skirts. No! They would surprise him at tea--she stood\\ntaut, lips compressed. Oh, the Plows were coming to tea. How\\nunfortunate, she thought. How fortunate, she said.\\n\\nThe child Monona made her knees and elbows stiff and danced up and down.\\nShe must, she must participate.\\n\\n\\\"Aunt Lulu made three pies!\\\" she screamed, and shook her straight hair.\\n\\n\\\"Gracious sakes,\\\" said Ninian. \\\"I brought her a pup, and if I didn't\\nforget to give it to her.\\\"\\n\\nThey adjourned to the porch--Ninian, Ina, Monona. The puppy was\\npresented, and yawned. The party kept on about \\\"the place.\\\" Ina\\ndelightedly exhibited the tomatoes, the two apple trees, the new shed,\\nthe bird bath. Ninian said the un-spellable \\\"m--m,\\\" rising inflection,\\nand the \\\"I see,\\\" prolonging the verb as was expected of him. Ina said\\nthat they meant to build a summer-house, only, dear me, when you have a\\nfamily--but there, he didn't know anything about that. Ina was using her\\neyes, she was arch, she was coquettish, she was flirtatious, and she\\nbelieved herself to be merely matronly, sisterly, womanly ...\\n\\nShe screamed. Dwight was at the gate. Now the meeting, exclamation,\\nbanality, guffaw ... good will.\\n\\nAnd Lulu, peeping through the blind.\\n\\nWhen \\\"tea\\\" had been experienced that evening, it was found that a light\\nrain was falling and the Deacons and their guests, the Plows, were\\nconstrained to remain in the parlour. The Plows were gentle, faintly\\nlustrous folk, sketched into life rather lightly, as if they were, say,\\nlooking in from some other level.\\n\\n\\\"The only thing,\\\" said Dwight Herbert, \\\"that reconciles me to rain is\\nthat I'm let off croquet.\\\" He rolled his r's, a favourite device of his\\nto induce humour. He called it \\\"croquette.\\\" He had never been more\\nirrepressible. The advent of his brother was partly accountable, the\\nneed to show himself a fine family man and host in a prosperous little\\nhome--simple and pathetic desire.\\n\\n\\\"Tell you what we'll do!\\\" said Dwight. \\\"Nin and I'll reminisce a\\nlittle.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do!\\\" cried Mr. Plow. This gentle fellow was always excited by life, so\\nfaintly excited by him, and enjoyed its presentation in any real form.\\n\\nNinian had unerringly selected a dwarf rocker, and he was overflowing it\\nand rocking.\\n\\n\\\"Take this chair, do!\\\" Ina begged. \\\"A big chair for a big man.\\\" She\\nspoke as if he were about the age of Monona.\\n\\nNinian refused, insisted on his refusal. A few years more, and human\\nrelationships would have spread sanity even to Ina's estate and she\\nwould have told him why he should exchange chairs. As it was she\\nforbore, and kept glancing anxiously at the over-burdened little beast\\nbeneath him.\\n\\nThe child Monona entered the room. She had been driven down by Di and\\nJenny Plow, who had vanished upstairs and, through the ventilator, might\\nbe heard in a lift and fall of giggling. Monona had also been driven\\nfrom the kitchen where Lulu was, for some reason, hurrying through the\\ndishes. Monona now ran to Mrs. Bett, stood beside her and stared about\\nresentfully. Mrs. Bett was in best black and ruches, and she seized upon\\nMonona and patted her, as her own form of social expression; and Monona\\nwriggled like a puppy, as hers.\\n\\n\\\"Quiet, pettie,\\\" said Ina, eyebrows up. She caught her lower lip in her\\nteeth.\\n\\n\\\"Well, sir,\\\" said Dwight, \\\"you wouldn't think it to look at us, but\\nmother had her hands pretty full, bringing us up.\\\"\\n\\nInto Dwight's face came another look. It was always so, when he spoke of\\nthis foster-mother who had taken these two boys and seen them through\\nthe graded schools. This woman Dwight adored, and when he spoke of her\\nhe became his inner self.\\n\\n\\\"We must run up-state and see her while you're here, Nin,\\\" he said.\\n\\nTo this Ninian gave a casual assent, lacking his brother's really tender\\nardour.\\n\\n\\\"Little,\\\" Dwight pursued, \\\"little did she think I'd settle down into a\\nnice, quiet, married dentist and magistrate in my town. And Nin\\ninto--say, Nin, what are you, anyway?\\\"\\n\\nThey laughed.\\n\\n\\\"That's the question,\\\" said Ninian.\\n\\nThey laughed.\\n\\n\\\"Maybe,\\\" Ina ventured, \\\"maybe Ninian will tell us something about his\\ntravels. He is quite a traveller, you know,\\\" she said to the Plows. \\\"A\\nregular Gulliver.\\\"\\n\\nThey laughed respectfully.\\n\\n\\\"How we should love it, Mr. Deacon,\\\" Mrs. Plow said. \\\"You know we've\\nnever seen _very_ much.\\\"\\n\\nGoaded on, Ninian launched upon his foreign countries as he had seen\\nthem: Population, exports, imports, soil, irrigation, business. For the\\npopulations Ninian had no respect. Crops could not touch ours. Soil\\nmighty poor pickings. And the business--say! Those fellows don't\\nknow--and, say, the hotels! Don't say foreign hotel to Ninian.\\n\\nHe regarded all the alien earth as barbarian, and he stoned it. He was\\nequipped for absolutely no intensive observation. His contacts were\\nnegligible. Mrs. Plow was more excited by the Deacons' party than Ninian\\nhad been wrought upon by all his voyaging.\\n\\n\\\"Tell you,\\\" said Dwight. \\\"When we ran away that time and went to the\\nstate fair, little did we think--\\\" He told about running away to the\\nstate fair. \\\"I thought,\\\" he wound up, irrelevantly, \\\"Ina and I might get\\nover to the other side this year, but I guess not. I guess not.\\\"\\n\\nThe words give no conception of their effect, spoken thus. For there in\\nWarbleton these words are not commonplace. In Warbleton, Europe is never\\nso casually spoken. \\\"Take a trip abroad\\\" is the phrase, or \\\"Go to\\nEurope\\\" at the very least, and both with empressement. Dwight had\\nsomewhere noted and deliberately picked up that \\\"other side\\\" effect, and\\nhis Ina knew this, and was proud. Her covert glance about pensively\\ncovered her soft triumph.\\n\\nMrs. Bett, her arm still circling the child Monona, now made her first\\nobservation.\\n\\n\\\"Pity not to have went while the going was good,\\\" she said, and said no\\nmore.\\n\\nNobody knew quite what she meant, and everybody hoped for the best. But\\nIna frowned. Mamma did these things occasionally when there was\\ncompany, and she dared. She never sauced Dwight in private.\\n\\nAnd it wasn't fair, it wasn't _fair_--\\n\\nAbruptly Ninian rose and left the room.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nThe dishes were washed. Lulu had washed them at break-neck speed--she\\ncould not, or would not, have told why. But no sooner were they finished\\nand set away than Lulu had been attacked by an unconquerable inhibition.\\nAnd instead of going to the parlour, she sat down by the kitchen window.\\nShe was in her chally gown, with her cameo pin and her string of coral.\\n\\nLaughter from the parlour mingled with the laughter of Di and Jenny\\nupstairs. Lulu was now rather shy of Di. A night or two before, coming\\nhome with \\\"extra\\\" cream, she had gone round to the side-door and had\\ncome full upon Di and Bobby, seated on the steps. And Di was saying:\\n\\n\\\"Well, if I marry you, you've simply got to be a great man. I could\\nnever marry just anybody. I'd _smother_.\\\"\\n\\nLulu had heard, stricken. She passed them by, responding only faintly to\\ntheir greeting. Di was far less taken aback than Lulu.\\n\\nLater Di had said to Lulu: \\\"I s'pose you heard what we were saying.\\\"\\n\\nLulu, much shaken, had withdrawn from the whole matter by a flat \\\"no.\\\"\\n\\\"Because,\\\" she said to herself, \\\"I couldn't have heard right.\\\"\\n\\nBut since then she had looked at Di as if Di were some one else. Had not\\nLulu taught her to make buttonholes and to hem--oh, no! Lulu could not\\nhave heard properly.\\n\\n\\\"Everybody's got somebody to be nice to them,\\\" she thought now, sitting\\nby the kitchen window, adult yet Cinderella.\\n\\nShe thought that some one would come for her. Her mother or even Ina.\\nPerhaps they would send Monona. She waited at first hopefully, then\\nresentfully. The grey rain wrapped the air.\\n\\n\\\"Nobody cares what becomes of me after they're fed,\\\" she thought, and\\nderived an obscure satisfaction from her phrasing, and thought it again.\\n\\nNinian Deacon came into the kitchen.\\n\\nHer first impression was that he had come to see whether the dog had\\nbeen fed.\\n\\n\\\"I fed him,\\\" she said, and wished that she had been busy when Ninian\\nentered.\\n\\n\\\"Who, me?\\\" he asked. \\\"You did that all right. Say, why in time don't you\\ncome in the other room?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I don't know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, neither do I. I've kept thinking, 'Why don't she come along.'\\nThen I remembered the dishes.\\\" He glanced about. \\\"I come to help wipe\\ndishes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" she laughed so delicately, so delightfully, one wondered where she\\ngot it. \\\"They're washed----\\\" she caught herself at \\\"long ago.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well then, what are you doing here?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Resting.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Rest in there.\\\" He bowed, crooked his arm. \\\"Se\\u00f1ora,\\\" he said,--his\\nSpanish matched his other assimilations of travel--\\n\\n\\\"Se\\u00f1ora. Allow me.\\\"\\n\\nLulu rose. On his arm she entered the parlour. Dwight was narrating and\\ndid not observe that entrance. To the Plows it was sufficiently normal.\\nBut Ina looked up and said:\\n\\n\\\"Well!\\\"--in two notes, descending, curving.\\n\\nLulu did not look at her. Lulu sat in a low rocker. Her starched white\\nskirt, throwing her chally in ugly lines, revealed a peeping rim of\\nwhite embroidery. Her lace front wrinkled when she sat, and perpetually\\nshe adjusted it. She curled her feet sidewise beneath her chair, her\\nlong wrists and veined hands lay along her lap in no relation to her.\\nShe was tense. She rocked.\\n\\nWhen Dwight had finished his narration, there was a pause, broken at\\nlast by Mrs. Bett:\\n\\n\\\"You tell that better than you used to when you started in telling it,\\\"\\nshe observed. \\\"You got in some things I guess you used to clean forget\\nabout. Monona, get off my rocker.\\\"\\n\\nMonona made a little whimpering sound, in pretence to tears. Ina said\\n\\\"Darling--quiet!\\\"--chin a little lifted, lower lip revealing lower\\nteeth for the word's completion; and she held it.\\n\\nThe Plows were asking something about Mexico. Dwight was wondering if it\\nwould let up raining _at all_. Di and Jenny came whispering into the\\nroom. But all these distractions Ninian Deacon swept aside.\\n\\n\\\"Miss Lulu,\\\" he said, \\\"I wanted you to hear about my trip up the Amazon,\\nbecause I knew how interested you are in travels.\\\"\\n\\nHe talked, according to his lights, about the Amazon. But the person who\\nmost enjoyed the recital could not afterward have told two words that\\nhe said. Lulu kept the position which she had taken at first, and she\\ndare not change. She saw the blood in the veins of her hands and wanted\\nto hide them. She wondered if she might fold her arms, or have one hand\\nto support her chin, gave it all up and sat motionless, save for the\\nrocking.\\n\\nThen she forgot everything. For the first time in years some one was\\ntalking and looking not only at Ina and Dwight and their guests, but at\\nher.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\n\\nJUNE\\n\\nOn a June morning Dwight Herbert Deacon looked at the sky, and said with\\nhis manner of originating it: \\\"How about a picnic this afternoon?\\\"\\n\\nIna, with her blank, upward look, exclaimed: \\\"To-_day?_\\\"\\n\\n\\\"First class day, it looks like to me.\\\"\\n\\nCome to think of it, Ina didn't know that there was anything to prevent,\\nbut mercy, Herbert was so sudden. Lulu began to recite the resources of\\nthe house for a lunch. Meanwhile, since the first mention of picnic, the\\nchild Monona had been dancing stiffly about the room, knees stiff,\\nelbows stiff, shoulders immovable, her straight hair flapping about her\\nface. The sad dance of the child who cannot dance because she never has\\ndanced. Di gave a conservative assent--she was at that age--and then\\ntook advantage of the family softness incident to a guest and demanded\\nthat Bobby go too. Ina hesitated, partly because she always hesitated,\\npartly because she was tribal in the extreme. \\\"Just our little family\\nand Uncle Ninian would have been so nice,\\\" she sighed, with her consent.\\n\\nWhen, at six o'clock, Ina and Dwight and Ninian assembled on the porch\\nand Lulu came out with the basket, it was seen that she was in a\\nblue-cotton house-gown.\\n\\n\\\"Look here,\\\" said Ninian, \\\"aren't you going?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Me?\\\" said Lulu. \\\"Oh, no.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why not?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I haven't been to a picnic since I can remember.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But why not?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I never think of such a thing.\\\"\\n\\nNinian waited for the family to speak. They did speak. Dwight said:\\n\\n\\\"Lulu's a regular home body.\\\"\\n\\nAnd Ina advanced kindly with: \\\"Come with us, Lulu, if you like.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Lulu, and flushed. \\\"Thank you,\\\" she added, formally.\\n\\nMrs. Bett's voice shrilled from within the house, startlingly\\nclose--just beyond the blind, in fact:\\n\\n\\\"Go on, Lulie. It'll do you good. You mind me and go on.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Ninian, \\\"that's what I say. You hustle for your hat and you\\ncome along.\\\"\\n\\nFor the first time this course presented itself to Lulu as a\\npossibility. She stared up at Ninian.\\n\\n\\\"You can slip on my linen duster, over,\\\" Ina said graciously.\\n\\n\\\"Your new one?\\\" Dwight incredulously wished to know.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no!\\\" Ina laughed at the idea. \\\"The old one.\\\"\\n\\nThey were having to wait for Di in any case--they always had to wait for\\nDi--and at last, hardly believing in her own motions, Lulu was running\\nto make ready. Mrs. Bett hurried to help her, but she took down the\\nwrong things and they were both irritated. Lulu reappeared in the linen\\nduster and a wide hat. There had been no time to \\\"tighten up\\\" her hair;\\nshe was flushed at the adventure; she had never looked so well.\\n\\nThey started. Lulu, falling in with Monona, heard for the first time in\\nher life, the step of the pursuing male, choosing to walk beside her and\\nthe little girl. Oh, would Ina like that? And what did Lulu care what\\nIna liked? Monona, making a silly, semi-articulate observation, was\\nenchanted to have Lulu burst into laughter and squeeze her hand.\\n\\nDi contributed her bright presence, and Bobby Larkin appeared from\\nnowhere, running, with a gigantic bag of fruit.\\n\\n\\\"Bullylujah!\\\" he shouted, and Lulu could have shouted with him.\\n\\nShe sought for some utterance. She wanted to talk with Ninian.\\n\\n\\\"I do hope we've brought sandwiches enough,\\\" was all that she could get\\nto say.\\n\\nThey chose a spot, that is to say Dwight Herbert chose a spot, across\\nthe river and up the shore where there was at that season a strip of\\nwarm beach. Dwight Herbert declared himself the builder of incomparable\\nfires, and made a bad smudge. Ninian, who was a camper neither by birth\\nnor by adoption, kept offering brightly to help, could think of nothing\\nto do, and presently, bethinking himself of skipping stones, went and\\ntried to skip them on the flowing river. Ina cut her hand opening the\\ncondensed milk and was obliged to sit under a tree and nurse the wound.\\nMonona spilled all the salt and sought diligently to recover it. So Lulu\\ndid all the work. As for Di and Bobby, they had taken the pail and gone\\nfor water, discouraging Monona from accompanying them, discouraging her\\nto the point of tears. But the two were gone for so long that on their\\nreturn Dwight was hungry and cross and majestic.\\n\\n\\\"Those who disregard the comfort of other people,\\\" he enunciated, \\\"can\\nnot expect consideration for themselves in the future.\\\"\\n\\nHe did not say on what ethical tenet this dictum was based, but he\\ndelivered it with extreme authority. Ina caught her lower lip with her\\nteeth, dipped her head, and looked at Di. And Monona laughed like a\\nlittle demon.\\n\\nAs soon as Lulu had all in readiness, and cold corned beef and salad had\\nbegun their orderly progression, Dwight became the immemorial dweller in\\ngreen fastnesses. He began:\\n\\n\\\"This is ideal. I tell you, people don't half know life if they don't\\nget out and eat in the open. It's better than any tonic at a dollar the\\nbottle. Nature's tonic--eh? Free as the air. Look at that sky. See that\\nwater. Could anything be more pleasant?\\\"\\n\\nHe smiled at his wife. This man's face was glowing with simple pleasure.\\nHe loved the out-of-doors with a love which could not explain itself.\\nBut he now lost a definite climax when his wife's comment was heard to\\nbe:\\n\\n\\\"Monona! Now it's all over both ruffles. And mamma does try so hard....\\\"\\n\\nAfter supper some boys arrived with a boat which they beached, and\\nDwight, with enthusiasm, gave the boys ten cents for a half hour's use\\nof that boat and invited to the waters his wife, his brother and his\\nyounger daughter. Ina was timid----not because she was afraid but because\\nshe was congenitally timid--with her this was not a belief or an\\nemotion, it was a disease.\\n\\n\\\"Dwight darling, are you sure there's no danger?\\\"\\n\\nWhy, none. None in the world. Whoever heard of drowning in a river.\\n\\n\\\"But you're not so very used----\\\"\\n\\nOh, wasn't he? Who was it that had lived in a boat throughout youth if\\nnot he?\\n\\nNinian refused out-of-hand, lighted a cigar, and sat on a log in a\\npermanent fashion. Ina's plump figure was fitted in the stern, the\\nchild Monona affixed, and the boat put off, bow well out of water. On\\nthis pleasure ride the face of the wife was as the face of the damned.\\nIt was true that she revered her husband's opinions above those of all\\nother men. In politics, in science, in religion, in dentistry she looked\\nup to his dicta as to revelation. And was he not a magistrate? But let\\nhim take oars in hand, or shake lines or a whip above the back of any\\nhorse, and this woman would trust any other woman's husband by\\npreference. It was a phenomenon.\\n\\nLulu was making the work last, so that she should be out of everybody's\\nway. When the boat put off without Ninian, she felt a kind of terror and\\nwished that he had gone. He had sat down near her, and she pretended not\\nto see. At last Lulu understood that Ninian was deliberately choosing to\\nremain with her. The languor of his bulk after the evening meal made no\\nexplanation for Lulu. She asked for no explanation. He had stayed.\\n\\nAnd they were alone. For Di, on a pretext of examining the flocks and\\nherds, was leading Bobby away to the pastures, a little at a time.\\n\\nThe sun, now fallen, had left an even, waxen sky. Leaves and ferns\\nappeared drenched with the light just withdrawn. The hush, the warmth,\\nthe colour, were charged with some influence. The air of the time\\ncommunicated itself to Lulu as intense and quiet happiness. She had not\\nyet felt quiet with Ninian. For the first time her blind excitement in\\nhis presence ceased, and she felt curiously accustomed to him. To him\\nthe air of the time imparted itself in a deepening of his facile\\nsympathy.\\n\\n\\\"Do you know something?\\\" he began. \\\"I think you have it pretty hard\\naround here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I?\\\" Lulu was genuinely astonished.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, sir. Do you have to work like this all the time? I guess you\\nwon't mind my asking.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I ought to work. I have a home with them. Mother too.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, but glory. You ought to have some kind of a life of your own. You\\nwant it, too. You told me you did--that first day.\\\"\\n\\nShe was silent. Again he was investing her with a longing which she had\\nnever really had, until he had planted that longing. She had wanted she\\nknew not what. Now she accepted the dim, the romantic interest of this\\nr\\u00f4le.\\n\\n\\\"I guess you don't see how it seems,\\\" he said, \\\"to me, coming along--a\\nstranger so. I don't like it.\\\"\\n\\nHe frowned, regarded the river, flicked away ashes, his diamond\\nobediently shining. Lulu's look, her head drooping, had the liquid air\\nof the look of a young girl. For the first time in her life she was\\nfeeling her helplessness. It intoxicated her.\\n\\n\\\"They're very good to me,\\\" she said.\\n\\nHe turned. \\\"Do you know why you think that? Because you've never had\\nanybody really good to you. That's why.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But they treat me good.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They make a slave of you. Regular slave.\\\" He puffed, frowning. \\\"Damned\\nshame, _I_ call it,\\\" he said.\\n\\nHer loyalty stirred Lulu. \\\"We have our whole living----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you earn it. I been watching you since I been here. Don't you ever\\ngo anywheres?\\\"\\n\\nShe said: \\\"This is the first place in--in years.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lord. Don't you want to? Of course you do!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not so much places like this----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I see. What you want is to get away--like you'd ought to.\\\" He regarded\\nher. \\\"You've been a blamed fine-looking woman,\\\" he said.\\n\\nShe did not flush, but that faint, unsuspected Lulu spoke for her:\\n\\n\\\"You must have been a good-looking man once yourself.\\\"\\n\\nHis laugh went ringing across the water. \\\"You're pretty good,\\\" he said.\\nHe regarded her approvingly. \\\"I don't see how you do it,\\\" he mused,\\n\\\"blamed if I do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How I do what?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why come back, quick like that, with what you say.\\\"\\n\\nLulu's heart was beating painfully. The effort to hold her own in talk\\nlike this was terrifying. She had never talked in this fashion to any\\none. It was as if some matter of life or death hung on her ability to\\nspeak an alien tongue. And yet, when she was most at loss, that other\\nLulu, whom she had never known anything about, seemed suddenly to speak\\nfor her. As now:\\n\\n\\\"It's my grand education,\\\" she said.\\n\\nShe sat humped on the log, her beautiful hair shining in the light of\\nthe warm sky. She had thrown off her hat and the linen duster, and was\\nin her blue gingham gown against the sky and leaves. But she sat\\nstiffly, her feet carefully covered, her hands ill at ease, her eyes\\nrather piteous in their hope somehow to hold her vague own. Yet from her\\ncame these sufficient, insouciant replies.\\n\\n\\\"Education,\\\" he said laughing heartily. \\\"That's mine, too.\\\" He spoke a\\ncreed. \\\"I ain't never had it and I ain't never missed it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Most folks are happy without an education,\\\" said Lulu.\\n\\n\\\"You're not very happy, though.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Well, sir,\\\" said Ninian, \\\"I'll tell you what we'll do. While I'm here\\nI'm going to take you and Ina and Dwight up to the city.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To the city?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To a show. Dinner and a show. I'll give you _one_ good time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" Lulu leaned forward. \\\"Ina and Dwight go sometimes. I never been.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, just you come with me. I'll look up what's good. You tell me\\njust what you like to eat, and we'll get it----\\\"\\n\\nShe said: \\\"I haven't had anything to eat in years that I haven't cooked\\nmyself.\\\"\\n\\nHe planned for that time to come, and Lulu listened as one intensely\\nexperiencing every word that he uttered. Yet it was not in that future\\nmerry-making that she found her joy, but in the consciousness that\\nhe--some one--any one--was planning like this for her.\\n\\nMeanwhile Di and Bobby had rounded the corner by an old hop-house and\\nkept on down the levee. Now that the presence of the others was\\nwithdrawn, the two looked about them differently and began themselves to\\ngive off an influence instead of being pressed upon by overpowering\\npersonalities. Frogs were chorusing in the near swamp, and Bobby wanted\\none. He was off after it. But Di eventually drew him back, reluctant,\\nfrogless. He entered upon an exhaustive account of the use of frogs for\\nbait, and as he talked he constantly flung stones. Di grew restless.\\nThere was, she had found, a certain amount of this to be gone through\\nbefore Bobby would focus on the personal. At length she was obliged to\\nsay, \\\"Like me to-day?\\\" And then he entered upon personal talk with the\\nsame zest with which he had discussed bait.\\n\\n\\\"Bobby,\\\" said Di, \\\"sometimes I think we might be married, and not wait\\nfor any old money.\\\"\\n\\nThey had now come that far. It was partly an authentic attraction, grown\\nfrom out the old repulsion, and partly it was that they both--and\\nespecially Di--so much wanted the experiences of attraction that they\\nassumed its ways. And then each cared enough to assume the pretty r\\u00f4le\\nrequired by the other, and by the occasion, and by the air of the time.\\n\\n\\\"Would you?\\\" asked Bobby--but in the subjunctive.\\n\\nShe said: \\\"Yes. I will.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It would mean running away, wouldn't it?\\\" said Bobby, still\\nsubjunctive.\\n\\n\\\"I suppose so. Mamma and papa are so unreasonable.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Di,\\\" said Bobby, \\\"I don't believe you could ever be happy with me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The idea! I can too. You're going to be a great man--you know you are.\\\"\\n\\nBobby was silent. Of course he knew it--but he passed it over.\\n\\n\\\"Wouldn't it be fun to elope and surprise the whole school?\\\" said Di,\\nsparkling.\\n\\nBobby grinned appreciatively. He was good to look at, with his big\\nframe, his head of rough dark hair, the sky warm upon his clear skin and\\nfull mouth. Di suddenly announced that she would be willing to elope\\n_now_.\\n\\n\\\"I've planned eloping lots of times,\\\" she said ambiguously.\\n\\nIt flashed across the mind of Bobby that in these plans of hers he may\\nnot always have been the principal, and he could not be sure ... But\\nshe talked in nothings, and he answered her so.\\n\\nSoft cries sounded in the centre of the stream. The boat, well out of\\nthe strong current, was seen to have its oars shipped; and there sat\\nDwight Herbert gently rocking the boat. Dwight Herbert would.\\n\\n\\\"Bertie, Bertie--please!\\\" you heard his Ina say.\\n\\nMonona began to cry, and her father was irritated, felt that it would be\\nignominious to desist, and did not know that he felt this. But he knew\\nthat he was annoyed, and he took refuge in this, and picked up the oars\\nwith: \\\"Some folks never can enjoy anything without spoiling it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's what I was thinking,\\\" said Ina, with a flash of anger.\\n\\nThey glided toward the shore in a huff. Monona found that she enjoyed\\ncrying across the water and kept it up. It was almost as good as an\\necho. Ina, stepping safe to the sands, cried ungratefully that this was\\nthe last time that she would ever, ever go with her husband anywhere.\\nEver. Dwight Herbert, recovering, gauged the moment to require of him\\nhumour, and observed that his wedded wife was as skittish as a colt. Ina\\nkept silence, head poised so that her full little chin showed double.\\nMonona, who had previously hidden a cooky in her frock, now remembered\\nit and crunched sidewise, the eyes ruminant.\\n\\nMoving toward them, with Di, Bobby was suddenly overtaken by the sense\\nof disliking them all. He never had liked Dwight Herbert, his employer.\\nMrs. Deacon seemed to him so overwhelmingly mature that he had no idea\\nhow to treat her. And the child Monona he would like to roll in the\\nriver. Even Di ... He fell silent, was silent on the walk home which was\\nthe signal for Di to tease him steadily. The little being was afraid of\\nsilence. It was too vast for her. She was like a butterfly in a dome.\\n\\nBut against that background of ruined occasion, Lulu walked homeward\\nbeside Ninian. And all that night, beside her mother who groaned in her\\nsleep, Lulu lay tense and awake. He had walked home with her. He had\\ntold Ina and Herbert about going to the city. What did it mean?\\nSuppose ... oh no; oh no!\\n\\n\\\"Either lay still or get up and set up,\\\" Mrs. Bett directed her at\\nlength.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\n\\nJULY\\n\\nWhen, on a warm evening a fortnight later, Lulu descended the stairs\\ndressed for her incredible trip to the city, she wore the white waist\\nwhich she had often thought they would \\\"use\\\" for her if she died. And\\nreally, the waist looked as if it had been planned for the purpose, and\\nits wide, upstanding plaited lace at throat and wrist made her neck look\\nthinner, her forearm sharp and veined. Her hair she had \\\"crimped\\\" and\\nparted in the middle, puffed high--it was so that hair had been worn in\\nLulu's girlhood.\\n\\n\\\"_Well_!\\\" said Ina, when she saw this coiffure, and frankly examined it,\\nhead well back, tongue meditatively teasing at her lower lip.\\n\\nFor travel Lulu was again wearing Ina's linen duster--the old one.\\n\\nNinian appeared, in a sack coat--and his diamond. His distinctly convex\\nface, its thick, rosy flesh, thick mouth and cleft chin gave Lulu once\\nmore that bold sense of looking--not at him, for then she was shy and\\naverted her eyes--but at his photograph at which she could gaze as much\\nas she would. She looked up at him openly, fell in step beside him. Was\\nhe not taking her to the city? Ina and Dwight themselves were going\\nbecause she, Lulu, had brought about this party.\\n\\n\\\"Act as good as you look, Lulie,\\\" Mrs. Bett called after them. She gave\\nno instructions to Ina who was married and able to shine in her conduct,\\nit seemed.\\n\\nDwight was cross. On the way to the station he might have been heard to\\ntake it up again, whatever it was, and his Ina unmistakably said: \\\"Well,\\nnow don't keep it going all the way there\\\"; and turned back to the\\nothers with some elaborate comment about the dust, thus cutting off her\\nso-called lord from his legitimate retort. A mean advantage.\\n\\nThe city was two hours' distant, and they were to spend the night. On\\nthe train, in the double seat, Ninian beside her among the bags, Lulu\\nsat in the simple consciousness that the people all knew that she too\\nhad been chosen. A man and a woman were opposite, with their little boy\\nbetween them. Lulu felt this woman's superiority of experience over her\\nown, and smiled at her from a world of fellowship. But the woman lifted\\nher eyebrows and stared and turned away, with slow and insolent winking.\\n\\nNinian had a boyish pride in his knowledge of places to eat in many\\ncities--as if he were leading certain of the tribe to a deer-run in a\\nstrange wood. Ninian took his party to a downtown caf\\u00e9, then popular\\namong business and newspaper men. The place was below the sidewalk, was\\nreached by a dozen marble steps, and the odour of its griddle-cakes took\\nthe air of the street. Ninian made a great show of selecting a table,\\nchanged once, called the waiter \\\"my man\\\" and rubbed soft hands on \\\"What\\ndo you say? Shall it be lobster?\\\" He ordered the dinner, instructing the\\nwaiter with painstaking gruffness.\\n\\n\\\"Not that they can touch _your_ cooking here, Miss Lulu,\\\" he said,\\nsettling himself to wait, and crumbling a crust.\\n\\nDwight, expanding a bit in the aura of the food, observed that Lulu was\\na regular chef, that was what Lulu was. He still would not look at his\\nwife, who now remarked:\\n\\n\\\"Sheff, Dwightie. Not cheff.\\\"\\n\\nThis was a mean advantage, which he pretended not to hear--another mean\\nadvantage.\\n\\n\\\"Ina,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"your hat's just a little mite--no, over the other\\nway.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Was there anything to prevent your speaking of that before?\\\" Ina\\ninquired acidly.\\n\\n\\\"I started to and then somebody always said something,\\\" said Lulu\\nhumbly.\\n\\nNothing could so much as cloud Lulu's hour. She was proof against any\\nshadow.\\n\\n\\\"Say, but you look tremendous to-night,\\\" Dwight observed to her.\\n\\nUnderstanding perfectly that this was said to tease his wife, Lulu yet\\nflushed with pleasure. She saw two women watching, and she thought:\\n\\\"They're feeling sorry for Ina--nobody talking to her.\\\" She laughed at\\neverything that the men said. She passionately wanted to talk herself.\\n\\\"How many folks keep going past,\\\" she said, many times.\\n\\nAt length, having noted the details of all the clothes in range, Ina's\\nisolation palled upon her and she set herself to take Ninian's\\nattention. She therefore talked with him about himself.\\n\\n\\\"Curious you've never married, Nin,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Don't say it like that,\\\" he begged. \\\"I might yet.\\\"\\n\\nIna laughed enjoyably. \\\"Yes, you might!\\\" she met this.\\n\\n\\\"She wants everybody to get married, but she wishes I hadn't,\\\" Dwight\\nthrew in with exceeding rancour.\\n\\nThey developed this theme exhaustively, Dwight usually speaking in the\\nthird person and always with his shoulder turned a bit from his wife. It\\nwas inconceivable, the gusto with which they proceeded. Ina had assumed\\nfor the purpose an air distrait, casual, attentive to the scene about\\nthem. But gradually her cheeks began to burn.\\n\\n\\\"She'll cry,\\\" Lulu thought in alarm, and said at random: \\\"Ina, that hat\\nis so pretty--ever so much prettier than the old one.\\\" But Ina said\\nfrostily that she never saw anything the matter with the old one.\\n\\n\\\"Let us talk,\\\" said Ninian low, to Lulu. \\\"Then they'll simmer down.\\\"\\n\\nHe went on, in an undertone, about nothing in particular. Lulu hardly\\nheard what he said, it was so pleasant to have him talking to her in\\nthis confidential fashion; and she was pleasantly aware that his manner\\nwas open to misinterpretation.\\n\\nIn the nick of time, the lobster was served.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nDinner and the play--the show, as Ninian called it. This show was \\\"Peter\\nPan,\\\" chosen by Ninian because the seats cost the most of those at any\\ntheatre. It was almost indecent to see how Dwight Herbert, the immortal\\nsoul, had warmed and melted at these contacts. By the time that all was\\nover, and they were at the hotel for supper, such was his pleasurable\\nexcitation that he was once more playful, teasing, once more the\\nirrepressible. But now his Ina was to be won back, made it evident that\\nshe was not one lightly to overlook, and a fine firmness sat upon the\\nlittle doubling chin.\\n\\nThey discussed the play. Not one of them had understood the story. The\\ndog-kennel part--wasn't that the queerest thing? Nothing to do with the\\nrest of the play.\\n\\n\\\"I was for the pirates. The one with the hook--he was my style,\\\" said\\nDwight.\\n\\n\\\"Well, there it is again,\\\" Ina cried. \\\"They didn't belong to the real\\nplay, either.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, well,\\\" Ninian said, \\\"they have to put in parts, I suppose, to catch\\neverybody. Instead of a song and dance, they do that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And I didn't understand,\\\" said Ina, \\\"why they all clapped when the\\nprincipal character ran down front and said something to the audience\\nthat time. But they all did.\\\"\\n\\nNinian thought this might have been out of compliment. Ina wished that\\nMonona might have seen, confessed that the last part was so pretty that\\nshe herself would not look; and into Ina's eyes came their loveliest\\nlight.\\n\\nLulu sat there, hearing the talk about the play. \\\"Why couldn't I have\\nsaid that?\\\" she thought as the others spoke. All that they said seemed\\nto her apropos, but she could think of nothing to add. The evening had\\nbeen to her a light from heaven--how could she find anything to say? She\\nsat in a daze of happiness, her mind hardly operative, her look moving\\nfrom one to another. At last Ninian looked at her.\\n\\n\\\"Sure you liked it, Miss Lulu?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes! I think they all took their parts real well.\\\"\\n\\nIt was not enough. She looked at them appealingly, knowing that she had\\nnot said enough.\\n\\n\\\"You could hear everything they said,\\\" she added. \\\"It was--\\\" she\\ndwindled to silence.\\n\\nDwight Herbert savoured his rarebit with a great show of long wrinkled\\ndimples.\\n\\n\\\"Excellent sauces they make here--excellent,\\\" he said, with the frown of\\nan epicure. \\\"A tiny wee bit more Athabasca,\\\" he added, and they all\\nlaughed and told him that Athabasca was a lake, of course. Of course he\\nmeant tobasco, Ina said. Their entertainment and their talk was of this\\nsort, for an hour.\\n\\n\\\"Well, now,\\\" said Dwight Herbert when it was finished, \\\"somebody dance\\non the table.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dwightie!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Got to amuse ourselves somehow. Come, liven up. They'll begin to read\\nthe funeral service over us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why not say the wedding service?\\\" asked Ninian.\\n\\nIn the mention of wedlock there was always something stimulating to\\nDwight, something of overwhelming humour. He shouted a derisive\\nendorsement of this proposal.\\n\\n\\\"I shouldn't object,\\\" said Ninian. \\\"Should you, Miss Lulu?\\\"\\n\\nLulu now burned the slow red of her torture. They were all looking at\\nher. She made an anguished effort to defend herself.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know it,\\\" she said, \\\"so I can't say it.\\\"\\n\\nNinian leaned toward her.\\n\\n\\\"I, Ninian, take thee, Lulu, to be my wedded wife,\\\" he pronounced.\\n\\\"That's the way it goes!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lulu daren't say it!\\\" cried Dwight. He laughed so loudly that those at\\nthe near tables turned. And, from the fastness of her wifehood and\\nmotherhood, Ina laughed. Really, it was ridiculous to think of Lulu that\\nway....\\n\\nNinian laughed too. \\\"Course she don't dare say it,\\\" he challenged.\\n\\nFrom within Lulu, that strange Lulu, that other Lulu who sometimes\\nfought her battles, suddenly spoke out:\\n\\n\\\"I, Lulu, take thee, Ninian, to be my wedded husband.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You will?\\\" Ninian cried.\\n\\n\\\"I will,\\\" she said, laughing tremulously, to prove that she too could\\njoin in, could be as merry as the rest.\\n\\n\\\"And I will. There, by Jove, now have we entertained you, or haven't\\nwe?\\\" Ninian laughed and pounded his soft fist on the table.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, say, honestly!\\\" Ina was shocked. \\\"I don't think you ought to--holy\\nthings----what's the _matter_, Dwightie?\\\"\\n\\nDwight Herbert Deacon's eyes were staring and his face was scarlet.\\n\\n\\\"Say, by George,\\\" he said, \\\"a civil wedding is binding in this state.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A civil wedding? Oh, well--\\\" Ninian dismissed it.\\n\\n\\\"But I,\\\" said Dwight, \\\"happen to be a magistrate.\\\"\\n\\nThey looked at one another foolishly. Dwight sprang up with the\\nindeterminate idea of inquiring something of some one, circled about and\\nreturned. Ina had taken his chair and sat clasping Lulu's hand. Ninian\\ncontinued to laugh.\\n\\n\\\"I never saw one done so offhand,\\\" said Dwight. \\\"But what you've said is\\nall you have to say according to law. And there don't have to be\\nwitnesses ... say!\\\" he said, and sat down again.\\n\\nAbove that shroud-like plaited lace, the veins of Lulu's throat showed\\ndark as she swallowed, cleared her throat, swallowed again.\\n\\n\\\"Don't you let Dwight scare you,\\\" she besought Ninian.\\n\\n\\\"Scare me!\\\" cried Ninian. \\\"Why, I think it's a good job done, if you ask\\nme.\\\"\\n\\nLulu's eyes flew to his face. As he laughed, he was looking at her, and\\nnow he nodded and shut and opened his eyes several times very fast.\\nTheir points of light flickered. With a pang of wonder which pierced her\\nand left her shaken, Lulu looked. His eyes continued to meet her own. It\\nwas exactly like looking at his photograph.\\n\\nDwight had recovered his authentic air.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, well,\\\" he said, \\\"we can inquire at our leisure. If it is necessary,\\nI should say we can have it set aside quietly up here in the city--no\\none'll be the wiser.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Set aside nothing!\\\" said Ninian. \\\"I'd like to see it stand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are you serious, Nin?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sure I'm serious.\\\"\\n\\nIna jerked gently at her sister's arm.\\n\\n\\\"Lulu! You hear him? What you going to say to that?\\\"\\n\\nLulu shook her head. \\\"He isn't in earnest,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"I am in earnest--hope to die,\\\" Ninian declared. He was on two legs of\\nhis chair and was slightly tilting, so that the effect of his\\nearnestness was impaired. But he was obviously in earnest.\\n\\nThey were looking at Lulu again. And now she looked at Ninian, and there\\nwas something terrible in that look which tried to ask him, alone, about\\nthis thing.\\n\\nDwight exploded. \\\"There was a fellow I know there in the theatre,\\\" he\\ncried. \\\"I'll get him on the line. He could tell me if there's any way--\\\"\\nand was off.\\n\\nIna inexplicably began touching away tears. \\\"Oh,\\\" she said, \\\"what will\\nmamma say?\\\"\\n\\nLulu hardly heard her. Mrs. Bett was incalculably distant.\\n\\n\\\"You sure?\\\" Lulu said low to Ninian.\\n\\nFor the first time, something in her exceeding isolation really touched\\nhim.\\n\\n\\\"Say,\\\" he said, \\\"you come on with me. We'll have it done over again\\nsomewhere, if you say so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"if I thought--\\\"\\n\\nHe leaned and patted her hand.\\n\\n\\\"Good girl,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThey sat silent, Ninian padding on the cloth with the flat of his plump\\nhands.\\n\\nDwight returned. \\\"It's a go all right,\\\" he said. He sat down, laughed\\nweakly, rubbed at his face. \\\"You two are tied as tight as the church\\ncould tie you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good enough,\\\" said Ninian. \\\"Eh, Lulu?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's--it's all right, I guess,\\\" Lulu said.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I'll be dished,\\\" said Dwight.\\n\\n\\\"Sister!\\\" said Ina.\\n\\nNinian meditated, his lips set tight and high. It is impossible to trace\\nthe processes of this man. Perhaps they were all compact of the\\ndevil-may-care attitude engendered in any persistent traveller. Perhaps\\nthe incomparable cookery of Lulu played its part.\\n\\n\\\"I was going to make a trip south this month,\\\" he said, \\\"on my way home\\nfrom here. Suppose we get married again by somebody or other, and start\\nright off. You'd like that, wouldn't you--going South?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Lulu only.\\n\\n\\\"It's July,\\\" said Ina, with her sense of fitness, but no one heard.\\n\\nIt was arranged that their trunks should follow them--Ina would see to\\nthat, though she was scandalised that they were not first to return to\\nWarbleton for the blessing of Mrs. Bett.\\n\\n\\\"Mamma won't mind,\\\" said Lulu. \\\"Mamma can't stand a fuss any more.\\\"\\n\\nThey left the table. The men and women still sitting at the other tables\\nsaw nothing unusual about these four, indifferently dressed,\\nindifferently conditioned. The hotel orchestra, playing ragtime in\\ndeafening concord, made Lulu's wedding march.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nIt was still early next day--a hot Sunday--when Ina and Dwight reached\\nhome. Mrs. Bett was standing on the porch.\\n\\n\\\"Where's Lulie?\\\" asked Mrs. Bett.\\n\\nThey told.\\n\\nMrs. Bett took it in, a bit at a time. Her pale eyes searched their\\nfaces, she shook her head, heard it again, grasped it. Her first\\nquestion was:\\n\\n\\\"Who's going to do your work?\\\"\\n\\nIna had thought of that, and this was manifest.\\n\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" she said, \\\"you and I'll have to manage.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Bett meditated, frowning.\\n\\n\\\"I left the bacon for her to cook for your breakfasts,\\\" she said. \\\"I\\ncan't cook bacon fit to eat. Neither can you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We've had our breakfasts,\\\" Ina escaped from this dilemma.\\n\\n\\\"Had it up in the city, on expense?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, we didn't have much.\\\"\\n\\nIn Mrs. Bett's eyes tears gathered, but they were not for Lulu.\\n\\n\\\"I should think,\\\" she said, \\\"I should think Lulie might have had a\\nlittle more gratitude to her than this.\\\"\\n\\nOn their way to church Ina and Dwight encountered Di, who had left the\\nhouse some time earlier, stepping sedately to church in company with\\nBobby Larkin. Di was in white, and her face was the face of an angel, so\\nyoung, so questioning, so utterly devoid of her sophistication.\\n\\n\\\"That child,\\\" said Ina, \\\"_must_ not see so much of that Larkin boy.\\nShe's just a little, little girl.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course she mustn't,\\\" said Dwight sharply, \\\"and if _I_ was her\\nmother--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh stop that!\\\" said Ina, sotto voce, at the church steps.\\n\\nTo every one with whom they spoke in the aisle after church, Ina\\nannounced their news: Had they heard? Lulu married Dwight's brother\\nNinian in the city yesterday. Oh, sudden, yes! And ro_man_tic ... spoken\\nwith that upward inflection to which Ina was a prey.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\nAUGUST\\n\\nMrs. Bett had been having a \\\"tantrim,\\\" brought on by nothing definable.\\nAbruptly as she and Ina were getting supper, Mrs. Bett had fallen\\nsilent, had in fact refused to reply when addressed. When all was ready\\nand Dwight was entering, hair wetly brushed, she had withdrawn from the\\nroom and closed her bedroom door until it echoed.\\n\\n\\\"She's got one again,\\\" said Ina, grieving; \\\"Dwight, you go.\\\"\\n\\nHe went, showing no sign of annoyance, and stood outside his\\nmother-in-law's door and knocked.\\n\\nNo answer.\\n\\n\\\"Mother, come and have some supper.\\\"\\n\\nNo answer.\\n\\n\\\"Looks to me like your muffins was just about the best ever.\\\"\\n\\nNo answer.\\n\\n\\\"Come on--I had something funny to tell you and Ina.\\\"\\n\\nHe retreated, knowing nothing of the admirable control exercised by this\\nwoman for her own passionate satisfaction in sliding him away\\nunsatisfied. He showed nothing but anxious concern, touched with regret,\\nat his failure. Ina, too, returned from that door discomfited. Dwight\\nmade a gallant effort to retrieve the fallen fortunes of their evening\\nmeal, and turned upon Di, who had just entered, and with exceeding\\nfacetiousness inquired how Bobby was.\\n\\nDi looked hunted. She could never tell whether her parents were going to\\ntease her about Bobby, or rebuke her for being seen with him. It\\ndepended on mood, and this mood Di had not the experience to gauge. She\\nnow groped for some neutral fact, and mentioned that he was going to\\ntake her and Jenny for ice cream that night.\\n\\nIna's irritation found just expression in office of motherhood.\\n\\n\\\"I won't have you downtown in the evening,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"But you let me go last night.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All the better reason why you should not go to-night.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I tell you,\\\" cried Dwight. \\\"Why not all walk down? Why not all have ice\\ncream....\\\" He was all gentleness and propitiation, the reconciling\\nelement in his home.\\n\\n\\\"Me too?\\\" Monona's ardent hope, her terrible fear were in her eyebrows,\\nher parted lips.\\n\\n\\\"You too, certainly.\\\" Dwight could not do enough for every one.\\n\\nMonona clapped her hands. \\\"Goody! goody! Last time you wouldn't let me\\ngo.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's why papa's going to take you this time,\\\" Ina said.\\n\\nThese ethical balances having been nicely struck, Ina proposed another:\\n\\n\\\"But,\\\" she said, \\\"but, you must eat more supper or you can _not_ go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't want any more.\\\" Monona's look was honest and piteous.\\n\\n\\\"Makes no difference. You must eat or you'll get sick.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well, then. No ice cream soda for such a little girl.\\\"\\n\\nMonona began to cry quietly. But she passed her plate. She ate, chewing\\nhigh, and slowly.\\n\\n\\\"See? She can eat if she will eat,\\\" Ina said to Dwight. \\\"The only\\ntrouble is, she will _not_ take the time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She don't put her mind on her meals,\\\" Dwight Herbert diagnosed it. \\\"Oh,\\nbigger bites than that!\\\" he encouraged his little daughter.\\n\\nDi's mind had been proceeding along its own paths.\\n\\n\\\"Are you going to take Jenny and Bobby too?\\\" she inquired.\\n\\n\\\"Certainly. The whole party.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Bobby'll want to pay for Jenny and I.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Me, darling,\\\" said Ina patiently, punctiliously--and less punctiliously\\nadded: \\\"Nonsense. This is going to be papa's little party.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But we had the engagement with Bobby. It was an engagement.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Ina, \\\"I think we'll just set that aside--that important\\nengagement. I think we just will.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Papa! Bobby'll want to be the one to pay for Jenny and I--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Di!\\\" Ina's voice dominated all. \\\"Will you be more careful of your\\ngrammar or shall I speak to you again?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I'd rather use bad grammar than--than--than--\\\" she looked\\nresentfully at her mother, her father. Their moral defection was evident\\nto her, but it was indefinable. They told her that she ought to be\\nashamed when papa wanted to give them all a treat. She sat silent,\\nfrowning, put-upon.\\n\\n\\\"Look, mamma!\\\" cried Monona, swallowing a third of an egg at one\\nimpulse. Ina saw only the empty plate.\\n\\n\\\"Mamma's nice little girl!\\\" cried she, shining upon her child.\\n\\nThe rules of the ordinary sports of the playground, scrupulously\\napplied, would have clarified the ethical atmosphere of this little\\nfamily. But there was no one to apply them.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nWhen Di and Monona had been excused, Dwight asked:\\n\\n\\\"Nothing new from the bride and groom?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. And, Dwight, it's been a week since the last.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"See--where were they then?\\\"\\n\\nHe knew perfectly well that they were in Savannah, Georgia, but Ina\\nplayed his game, told him, and retold bits that the letter had said.\\n\\n\\\"I don't understand,\\\" she added, \\\"why they should go straight to Oregon\\nwithout coming here first.\\\"\\n\\nDwight hazarded that Nin probably had to get back, and shone pleasantly\\nin the reflected importance of a brother filled with affairs.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know what to make of Lulu's letters,\\\" Ina proceeded. \\\"They're\\nso--so--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You haven't had but two, have you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's all--well, of course it's only been a month. But both letters\\nhave been so--\\\"\\n\\nIna was never really articulate. Whatever corner of her brain had the\\nblood in it at the moment seemed to be operative, and she let the matter\\ngo at that.\\n\\n\\\"I don't think it's fair to mamma--going off that way. Leaving her own\\nmother. Why, she may never see mamma again--\\\" Ina's breath caught. Into\\nher face came something of the lovely tenderness with which she\\nsometimes looked at Monona and Di. She sprang up. She had forgotten to\\nput some supper to warm for mamma. The lovely light was still in her\\nface as she bustled about against the time of mamma's recovery from her\\ntantrim. Dwight's face was like this when he spoke of his foster-mother.\\nIn both these beings there was something which functioned as pure love.\\n\\nMamma had recovered and was eating cold scrambled eggs on the corner of\\nthe kitchen table when the ice cream soda party was ready to set out.\\nDwight threw her a casual \\\"Better come, too, Mother Bett,\\\" but she shook\\nher head. She wished to go, wished it with violence, but she contrived\\nto give to her arbitrary refusal a quality of contempt. When Jenny\\narrived with Bobby, she had brought a sheaf of gladioli for Mrs. Bett,\\nand took them to her in the kitchen, and as she laid the flowers beside\\nher, the young girl stopped and kissed her. \\\"You little darling!\\\" cried\\nMrs. Bett, and clung to her, her lifted eyes lit by something intense\\nand living. But when the ice cream party had set off at last, Mrs. Bett\\nleft her supper, gathered up the flowers, and crossed the lawn to the\\nold cripple, Grandma Gates.\\n\\n\\\"Inie sha'n't have 'em,\\\" the old woman thought.\\n\\nAnd then it was quite beautiful to watch her with Grandma Gates, whom\\nshe tended and petted, to whose complainings she listened, and to whom\\nshe tried to tell the small events of her day. When her neighbour had\\ngone, Grandma Gates said that it was as good as a dose of medicine to\\nhave her come in.\\n\\nMrs. Bett sat on the porch restored and pleasant when the family\\nreturned. Di and Bobby had walked home with Jenny.\\n\\n\\\"Look here,\\\" said Dwight Herbert, \\\"who is it sits home and has _ice_\\ncream put in her lap, like a queen?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Vanilly or chocolate?\\\" Mrs. Bett demanded.\\n\\n\\\"Chocolate, mammal\\\" Ina cried, with the breeze in her voice.\\n\\n\\\"Vanilly sets better,\\\" Mrs. Bett said.\\n\\nThey sat with her on the porch while she ate. Ina rocked on a creaking\\nboard. Dwight swung a leg over the railing. Monona sat pulling her skirt\\nover her feet, and humming all on one note. There was no moon, but the\\nwarm dusk had a quality of transparency as if it were lit in all its\\nparticles.\\n\\nThe gate opened, and some one came up the walk. They looked, and it was\\nLulu.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\n\\\"Well, if it ain't Miss Lulu Bett!\\\" Dwight cried involuntarily, and Ina\\ncried out something.\\n\\n\\\"How did you know?\\\" Lulu asked.\\n\\n\\\"Know! Know what?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That it ain't Lulu Deacon. Hello, mamma.\\\"\\n\\nShe passed the others, and kissed her mother.\\n\\n\\\"Say,\\\" said Mrs. Bett placidly. \\\"And I just ate up the last spoonful o'\\ncream.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ain't Lulu Deacon!\\\" Ina's voice rose and swelled richly. \\\"What you\\ntalking?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Didn't he write to you?\\\" Lulu asked.\\n\\n\\\"Not a word.\\\" Dwight answered this. \\\"All we've had we had from you--the\\nlast from Savannah, Georgia.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Savannah, Georgia,\\\" said Lulu, and laughed.\\n\\nThey could see that she was dressed well, in dark red cloth, with a\\nlittle tilting hat and a drooping veil. She did not seem in any wise\\nupset, nor, save for that nervous laughter, did she show her excitement.\\n\\n\\\"Well, but he's here with you, isn't he?\\\" Dwight demanded. \\\"Isn't he\\nhere? Where is he?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Must be 'most to Oregon by this time,\\\" Lulu said.\\n\\n\\\"Oregon!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You see,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"he had another wife.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, he had not!\\\" exclaimed Dwight absurdly.\\n\\n\\\"Yes. He hasn't seen her for fifteen years and he thinks she's dead.\\nBut he isn't sure.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nonsense,\\\" said Dwight. \\\"Why, of course she's dead if he thinks so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I had to be sure,\\\" said Lulu.\\n\\nAt first dumb before this, Ina now cried out: \\\"Monona! Go upstairs to\\nbed at once.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's only quarter to,\\\" said Monona, with assurance.\\n\\n\\\"Do as mamma tells you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Monona!\\\"\\n\\nShe went, kissing them all good-night and taking her time about it.\\nEverything was suspended while she kissed them and departed, walking\\nslowly backward.\\n\\n\\\"Married?\\\" said Mrs. Bett with tardy apprehension. \\\"Lulie, was your\\nhusband married?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" Lulu said, \\\"my husband was married, mother.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mercy,\\\" said Ina. \\\"Think of anything like that in our family.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, go on--go on!\\\" Dwight cried. \\\"Tell us about it.\\\"\\n\\nLulu spoke in a monotone, with her old manner of hesitation:\\n\\n\\\"We were going to Oregon. First down to New Orleans and then out to\\nCalifornia and up the coast.\\\" On this she paused and sighed. \\\"Well, then\\nat Savannah, Georgia, he said he thought I better know, first. So he\\ntold me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes--well, what did he _say_?\\\" Dwight demanded irritably.\\n\\n\\\"Cora Waters,\\\" said Lulu. \\\"Cora Waters. She married him down in San\\nDiego, eighteen years ago. She went to South America with him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, he never let us know of it, if she did,\\\" said Dwight.\\n\\n\\\"No. She married him just before he went. Then in South America, after\\ntwo years, she ran away again. That's all he knows.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's a pretty story,\\\" said Dwight contemptuously.\\n\\n\\\"He says if she'd been alive, she'd been after him for a divorce. And\\nshe never has been, so he thinks she must be dead. The trouble is,\\\" Lulu\\nsaid again, \\\"he wasn't sure. And I had to be sure.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, but mercy,\\\" said Ina, \\\"couldn't he find out now?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It might take a long time,\\\" said Lulu simply, \\\"and I didn't want to\\nstay and not know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, then, why didn't he say so here?\\\" Ina's indignation mounted.\\n\\n\\\"He would have. But you know how sudden everything was. He said he\\nthought about telling us right there in the restaurant, but of course\\nthat'd been hard--wouldn't it? And then he felt so sure she was dead.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why did he tell you at all, then?\\\" demanded Ina, whose processes were\\nsimple.\\n\\n\\\"Yes. Well! Why indeed?\\\" Dwight Herbert brought out these words with a\\ncurious emphasis.\\n\\n\\\"I thought that, just at first,\\\" Lulu said, \\\"but only just at first. Of\\ncourse that wouldn't have been right. And then, you see, he gave me my\\nchoice.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gave you your choice?\\\" Dwight echoed.\\n\\n\\\"Yes. About going on and taking the chances. He gave me my choice when\\nhe told me, there in Savannah, Georgia.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What made him conclude, by then, that you ought to be told?\\\" Dwight\\nasked.\\n\\n\\\"Why, he'd got to thinking about it,\\\" she answered.\\n\\nA silence fell. Lulu sat looking out toward the street.\\n\\n\\\"The only thing,\\\" she said, \\\"as long as it happened, I kind of wish he\\nhadn't told me till we got to Oregon.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lulu!\\\" said Ina. Ina began to cry. \\\"You poor thing!\\\" she said.\\n\\nHer tears were a signal to Mrs. Bett, who had been striving to\\nunderstand all. Now she too wept, tossing up her hands and rocking her\\nbody. Her saucer and spoon clattered on her knee.\\n\\n\\\"He felt bad too,\\\" Lulu said.\\n\\n\\\"He!\\\" said Dwight. \\\"He must have.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's you,\\\" Ina sobbed. \\\"It's you. _My_ sister!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"but I never thought of it making you both feel bad,\\nor I wouldn't have come home. I knew,\\\" she added, \\\"it'd make Dwight feel\\nbad. I mean, it was his brother--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thank goodness,\\\" Ina broke in, \\\"nobody need know about it.\\\"\\n\\nLulu regarded her, without change.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes,\\\" she said in her monotone. \\\"People will have to know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not see the necessity.\\\" Dwight's voice was an edge. Then too he\\nsaid \\\"do not,\\\" always with Dwight betokening the finalities.\\n\\n\\\"Why, what would they think?\\\" Lulu asked, troubled.\\n\\n\\\"What difference does it make what they think?\\\".\\n\\n\\\"Why,\\\" said Lulu slowly, \\\"I shouldn't like--you see they might--why,\\nDwight, I think we'll have to tell them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You do! You think the disgrace of bigamy in this family is something\\nthe whole town will have to know about?\\\"\\n\\nLulu looked at him with parted lips.\\n\\n\\\"Say,\\\" she said, \\\"I never thought about it being that.\\\"\\n\\nDwight laughed. \\\"What did you think it was? And whose disgrace is it,\\npray?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ninian's,\\\" said Lulu.\\n\\n\\\"Ninian's! Well, he's gone. But you're here. And I'm here. Folks'll feel\\nsorry for you. But the disgrace--that'd reflect on me. See?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But if we don't tell, what'll they think then?\\\"\\n\\nSaid Dwight: \\\"They'll think what they always think when a wife leaves\\nher husband. They'll think you couldn't get along. That's all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should hate that,\\\" said Lulu.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I should hate the other, let me tell you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dwight, Dwight,\\\" said Ina. \\\"Let's go in the house. I'm afraid they'll\\nhear--\\\"\\n\\nAs they rose, Mrs. Bett plucked at her returned daughter's sleeve.\\n\\n\\\"Lulie,\\\" she said, \\\"was his other wife--was she _there_?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no, mother. She wasn't there.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Bett's lips moved, repeating the words. \\\"Then that ain't so bad,\\\"\\nshe said. \\\"I was afraid maybe she turned you out.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" Lulu said, \\\"it wasn't that bad, mother.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Bett brightened. In little matters, she quarrelled and resented,\\nbut the large issues left her blank.\\n\\nThrough some indeterminate sense of the importance due this crisis, the\\nDeacons entered their parlour. Dwight lighted that high, central burner\\nand faced about, saying:\\n\\n\\\"In fact, I simply will not have it, Lulu! You expect, I take it, to\\nmake your home with us in the future, on the old terms.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I mean, did Ninian give you any money?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. He didn't give me any money--only enough to get home on. And I\\nkept my suit--why!\\\" she flung her head back, \\\"I wouldn't have taken any\\nmoney!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That means,\\\" said Dwight, \\\"that you will have to continue to live\\nhere--on the old terms, and of course I'm quite willing that you should.\\nLet me tell you, however, that this is on condition--on condition that\\nthis disgraceful business is kept to ourselves.\\\"\\n\\nShe made no attempt to combat him now. She looked back at him,\\nquivering, and in a great surprise, but she said nothing.\\n\\n\\\"Truly, Lulu,\\\" said Ina, \\\"wouldn't that be best? They'll talk anyway.\\nBut this way they'll only talk about you, and the other way it'd be\\nabout all of us.\\\"\\n\\nLulu said only: \\\"But the other way would be the truth.\\\"\\n\\nDwight's eyes narrowed: \\\"My dear Lulu,\\\" he said, \\\"are you _sure_ of\\nthat?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sure?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. Did he give you any proofs?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Proofs?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Letters--documents of any sort? Any sort of assurance that he was\\nspeaking the truth?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, no,\\\" said Lulu. \\\"Proofs--no. He told me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He told you!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, that was hard enough to have to do. It was terrible for him to\\nhave to do. What proofs--\\\" She stopped, puzzled.\\n\\n\\\"Didn't it occur to you,\\\" said Dwight, \\\"that he might have told you that\\nbecause he didn't want to have to go on with it?\\\"\\n\\nAs she met his look, some power seemed to go from Lulu. She sat down,\\nlooked weakly at them, and within her closed lips her jaw was slightly\\nfallen. She said nothing. And seeing on her skirt a spot of dust she\\nbegan to rub at that.\\n\\n\\\"Why, Dwight!\\\" Ina cried, and moved to her sister's side.\\n\\n\\\"I may as well tell you,\\\" he said, \\\"that I myself have no idea that\\nNinian told you the truth. He was always imagining things--you saw\\nthat. I know him pretty well--have been more or less in touch with him\\nthe whole time. In short, I haven't the least idea he was ever married\\nbefore.\\\"\\n\\nLulu continued to rub at her skirt.\\n\\n\\\"I never thought of that,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Look here,\\\" Dwight went on persuasively, \\\"hadn't you and he had some\\nlittle tiff when he told you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No--no! Why, not once. Why, we weren't a bit like you and Ina.\\\"\\n\\nShe spoke simply and from her heart and without guile.\\n\\n\\\"Evidently not,\\\" Dwight said drily.\\n\\nLulu went on: \\\"He was very good to me. This dress--and my shoes--and my\\nhat. And another dress, too.\\\" She found the pins and took off her hat.\\n\\\"He liked the red wing,\\\" she said. \\\"I wanted black--oh, Dwight! He did\\ntell me the truth!\\\" It was as if the red wing had abruptly borne mute\\nwitness.\\n\\nDwight's tone now mounted. His manner, it mounted too.\\n\\n\\\"Even if it is true,\\\" said he, \\\"I desire that you should keep silent\\nand protect my family from this scandal. I merely mention my doubts to\\nyou for your own profit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My own profit!\\\"\\n\\nShe said no more, but rose and moved to the door.\\n\\n\\\"Lulu--you see! With Di and all!\\\" Ina begged. \\\"We just couldn't have\\nthis known--even if it was so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have it in your hands,\\\" said Dwight, \\\"to repay me, Lulu, for\\nanything that you feel I may have done for you in the past. You also\\nhave it in your hands to decide whether your home here continues. That\\nis not a pleasant position for me to find myself in. It is distinctly\\nunpleasant, I may say. But you see for yourself.\\\"\\n\\nLulu went on, into the passage.\\n\\n\\\"Wasn't she married when she thought she was?\\\" Mrs. Bett cried shrilly.\\n\\n\\\"Mamma,\\\" said Ina. \\\"Do, please, remember Monona. Yes--Dwight thinks\\nshe's married all right now--and that it's all right, all the time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I hope so, for pity sakes,\\\" said Mrs. Bett, and left the room\\nwith her daughter.\\n\\nHearing the stir, Monona upstairs lifted her voice:\\n\\n\\\"Mamma! Come on and hear my prayers, why don't you?\\\"\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nWhen they came downstairs next morning, Lulu had breakfast ready.\\n\\n\\\"Well!\\\" cried Ina in her curving tone, \\\"if this isn't like old times.\\\"\\n\\nLulu said yes, that it was like old times, and brought the bacon to the\\ntable.\\n\\n\\\"Lulu's the only one in _this_ house can cook the bacon so's it'll\\nchew,\\\" Mrs. Bett volunteered. She was wholly affable, and held\\ncontentedly to Ina's last word that Dwight thought now it was all right.\\n\\n\\\"Ho!\\\" said Dwight. \\\"The happy family, once more about the festive\\ntoaster.\\\" He gauged the moment to call for good cheer. Ina, too, became\\nbreezy, blithe. Monona caught their spirit and laughed, head thrown well\\nback and gently shaken.\\n\\nDi came in. She had been told that Auntie Lulu was at home, and that\\nshe, Di, wasn't to say anything to her about anything, nor anything to\\nanybody else about Auntie Lulu being back. Under these prohibitions,\\nwhich loosed a thousand speculations, Di was very nearly paralysed. She\\nstared at her Aunt Lulu incessantly.\\n\\nNot one of them had even a talent for the casual, save Lulu herself.\\nLulu was amazingly herself. She took her old place, assumed her old\\noffices. When Monona declared against bacon, it was Lulu who suggested\\nmilk toast and went to make it.\\n\\n\\\"Mamma,\\\" Di whispered then, like escaping steam, \\\"isn't Uncle Ninian\\ncoming too?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hush. No. Now don't ask any more questions.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, can't I tell Bobby and Jenny she's here?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"_No_. Don't say anything at all about her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, mamma. What has she done?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Di! Do as mamma tells you. Don't you think mamma knows best?\\\"\\n\\nDi of course did not think so, had not thought so for a long time. But\\nnow Dwight said:\\n\\n\\\"Daughter! Are you a little girl or are you our grown-up young lady?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know,\\\" said Di reasonably, \\\"but I think you're treating me like\\na little girl now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Shame, Di,\\\" said Ina, unabashed by the accident of reason being on the\\nside of Di.\\n\\n\\\"I'm eighteen,\\\" Di reminded them forlornly, \\\"and through high school.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then act so,\\\" boomed her father.\\n\\nBaffled, thwarted, bewildered, Di went over to Jenny Plow's and there\\nimparted understanding by the simple process of letting Jenny guess, to\\nquestions skilfully shaped.\\n\\nWhen Dwight said, \\\"Look at my beautiful handkerchief,\\\" displayed a\\nhole, sent his Ina for a better, Lulu, with a manner of haste, addressed\\nhim:\\n\\n\\\"Dwight. It's a funny thing, but I haven't Ninian's Oregon address.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I wish you'd give it to me.\\\"\\n\\nDwight tightened and lifted his lips. \\\"It would seem,\\\" he said, \\\"that\\nyou have no real use for that particular address, Lulu.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I have. I want it. You have it, haven't you, Dwight?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly I have it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Won't you please write it down for me?\\\" She had ready a bit of paper\\nand a pencil stump.\\n\\n\\\"My dear Lulu, now why revive anything? Why not be sensible and leave\\nthis alone? No good can come by--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But why shouldn't I have his address?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If everything is over between you, why should you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you say he's still my husband.\\\"\\n\\nDwight flushed. \\\"If my brother has shown his inclination as plainly as\\nI judge that he has, it is certainly not my place to put you in touch\\nwith him again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You won't give it to me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My dear Lulu, in all kindness--no.\\\"\\n\\nHis Ina came running back, bearing handkerchiefs with different coloured\\nborders for him to choose from. He chose the initial that she had\\nembroidered, and had not the good taste not to kiss her.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nThey were all on the porch that evening, when Lulu came downstairs.\\n\\n\\\"_Where_ are you going?\\\" Ina demanded, sisterly. And on hearing that\\nLulu had an errand, added still more sisterly; \\\"Well, but mercy, what\\nyou so dressed up for?\\\"\\n\\nLulu was in a thin black and white gown which they had never seen, and\\nwore the tilting hat with the red wing.\\n\\n\\\"Ninian bought me this,\\\" said Lulu only.\\n\\n\\\"But, Lulu, don't you think it might be better to keep, well--out of\\nsight for a few days?\\\" Ina's lifted look besought her.\\n\\n\\\"Why?\\\" Lulu asked.\\n\\n\\\"Why set people wondering till we have to?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They don't have to wonder, far as I'm concerned,\\\" said Lulu, and went\\ndown the walk.\\n\\nIna looked at Dwight. \\\"She never spoke to me like that in her life\\nbefore,\\\" she said.\\n\\nShe watched her sister's black and white figure going erectly down the\\nstreet.\\n\\n\\\"That gives me the funniest feeling,\\\" said Ina, \\\"as if Lulu had on\\nclothes bought for her by some one that wasn't--that was--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"By her husband who has left her,\\\" said Dwight sadly.\\n\\n\\\"Is that what it is, papa?\\\" Di asked alertly. For a wonder, she was\\nthere; had been there the greater part of the day--most of the time\\nstaring, fascinated, at her Aunt Lulu.\\n\\n\\\"That's what it is, my little girl,\\\" said Dwight, and shook his head.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I think it's a shame,\\\" said Di stoutly. \\\"And I think Uncle Ninian\\nis a slunge.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Di!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do. And I'd be ashamed to think anything else. I'd like to tell\\neverybody.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is,\\\" said Dwight, \\\"no need for secrecy--now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dwight!\\\" said Ina--Ina's eyes always remained expressionless, but it\\nmust have been her lashes that looked so startled.\\n\\n\\\"No need whatever for secrecy,\\\" he repeated with firmness. \\\"The truth\\nis, Lulu's husband has tired of her and sent her home. We must face it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, Dwight--how awful for Lulu....\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lulu,\\\" said Dwight, \\\"has us to stand by her.\\\"\\n\\nLulu, walking down the main street, thought:\\n\\n\\\"Now Mis' Chambers is seeing me. Now Mis' Curtis. There's somebody\\nbehind the vines at Mis' Martin's. Here comes Mis' Grove and I've got\\nto speak to her....\\\"\\n\\nOne and another and another met her, and every one cried out at her some\\nversion of:\\n\\n\\\"Lulu Bett!\\\" Or, \\\"W-well, it _isn't_ Lulu Bett any more, is it? Well,\\nwhat are you doing here? I thought....\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm back to stay,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"The idea! Well, where you hiding that handsome husband of yours? Say,\\nbut we were surprised! You're the sly one--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My--Mr. Deacon isn't here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. He's West.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I see.\\\"\\n\\nHaving no arts, she must needs let the conversation die like this, could\\ninvent nothing concealing or gracious on which to move away.\\n\\nShe went to the post-office. It was early, there were few at the\\npost-office--with only one or two there had she to go through her\\nexamination. Then she went to the general delivery window, tense for a\\nnew ordeal.\\n\\nTo her relief, the face which was shown there was one strange to her, a\\nslim youth, reading a letter of his own, and smiling.\\n\\n\\\"Excuse me,\\\" said Lulu faintly.\\n\\nThe youth looked up, with eyes warmed by the words on the pink paper\\nwhich he held.\\n\\n\\\"Could you give me the address of Mr. Ninian Deacon?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let's see--you mean Dwight Deacon, I guess?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. It's his brother. He's been here. From Oregon. I thought he might\\nhave given you his address--\\\" she dwindled away.\\n\\n\\\"Wait a minute,\\\" said the youth. \\\"Nope. No address here. Say, why don't\\nyou send it to his brother? He'd know. Dwight Deacon, the dentist.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll do that,\\\" Lulu said absurdly, and turned away.\\n\\nShe went back up the street, walking fast now to get away from them\\nall. Once or twice she pretended not to see a familiar face. But when\\nshe passed the mirror in an insurance office window, she saw her\\nreflection and at its appearance she felt surprise and pleasure.\\n\\n\\\"Well!\\\" she thought, almost in Ina's own manner.\\n\\nAbruptly her confidence rose.\\n\\nSomething of this confidence was still upon her when she returned. They\\nwere in the dining-room now, all save Di, who was on the porch with\\nBobby, and Monona, who was in bed and might be heard extravagantly\\nsinging.\\n\\nLulu sat down with her hat on. When Dwight inquired playfully, \\\"Don't we\\nlook like company?\\\" she did not reply. He looked at her speculatively.\\nWhere had she gone, with whom had she talked, what had she told? Ina\\nlooked at her rather fearfully. But Mrs. Bett rocked contentedly and ate\\ncardamom seeds.\\n\\n\\\"Whom did you see?\\\" Ina asked.\\n\\nLulu named them.\\n\\n\\\"See them to talk to?\\\" from Dwight.\\n\\nOh, yes. They had all stopped.\\n\\n\\\"What did they say?\\\" Ina burst out.\\n\\nThey had inquired for Ninian, Lulu said; and said no more.\\n\\nDwight mulled this. Lulu might have told every one of these women that\\ncock-and-bull story with which she had come home. It might be all over\\ntown. Of course, in that case he could turn Lulu out--should do so, in\\nfact. Still the story would be all over town.\\n\\n\\\"Dwight,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"I want Ninian's address.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Going to write to him!\\\" Ina cried incredulously.\\n\\n\\\"I want to ask him for the proofs that Dwight wanted.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My dear Lulu,\\\" Dwight said impatiently, \\\"you are not the one to write.\\nHave you no delicacy?\\\"\\n\\nLulu smiled--a strange smile, originating and dying in one corner of\\nher mouth.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" she said. \\\"So much delicacy that I want to be sure whether I'm\\nmarried or not.\\\"\\n\\nDwight cleared his throat with a movement which seemed to use his\\nshoulders for the purpose.\\n\\n\\\"I myself will take this up with my brother,\\\" he said. \\\"I will write to\\nhim about it.\\\"\\n\\nLulu sprang to her feet. \\\"Write to him _now_!\\\" she cried.\\n\\n\\\"Really,\\\" said Dwight, lifting his brows.\\n\\n\\\"Now--now!\\\" Lulu said. She moved about, collecting writing materials\\nfrom their casual lodgments on shelf and table. She set all before him\\nand stood by him. \\\"Write to him now,\\\" she said again.\\n\\n\\\"My dear Lulu, don't be absurd.\\\"\\n\\nShe said: \\\"Ina. Help me. If it was Dwight--and they didn't know whether\\nhe had another wife, or not, and you wanted to ask him--oh, don't you\\nsee? Help me.\\\"\\n\\nIna was not yet the woman to cry for justice for its own sake, nor even\\nto stand by another woman. She was primitive, and her instinct was to\\nlook to her own male merely.\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" she said, \\\"of course. But why not let Dwight do it in his own\\nway? Wouldn't that be better?\\\"\\n\\nShe put it to her sister fairly: Now, no matter what Dwight's way was,\\nwouldn't that be better?\\n\\n\\\"Mother!\\\" said Lulu. She looked irresolutely toward her mother. But Mrs.\\nBett was eating cardamom seeds with exceeding gusto, and Lulu looked\\naway. Caught by the gesture, Mrs. Bett voiced her grievance.\\n\\n\\\"Lulie,\\\" she said, \\\"Set down. Take off your hat, why don't you?\\\"\\n\\nLulu turned upon Dwight a quiet face which he had never seen before.\\n\\n\\\"You write that letter to Ninian,\\\" she said, \\\"and you make him tell you\\nso you'll understand. _I_ know he spoke the truth. But I want you to\\nknow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"M--m,\\\" said Dwight. \\\"And then I suppose you're going to tell it all\\nover town--as soon as you have the proofs.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm going to tell it all over town,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"just as it is--unless\\nyou write to him now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lulu!\\\" cried Ina. \\\"Oh, you wouldn't.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I would,\\\" said Lulu. \\\"I will.\\\"\\n\\nDwight was sobered. This unimagined Lulu looked capable of it. But then\\nhe sneered.\\n\\n\\\"And get turned out of this house, as you would be?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dwight!\\\" cried his Ina. \\\"Oh, you wouldn't!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I would,\\\" said Dwight. \\\"I will. Lulu knows it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I shall tell what I know and then leave your house anyway,\\\" said Lulu,\\n\\\"unless you get Ninian's word. And I want you should write him now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Leave your mother? And Ina?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"Leave everything,\\\" said Lulu.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Dwight,\\\" said Ina, \\\"we can't get along without Lulu.\\\" She did not\\nsay in what particulars, but Dwight knew.\\n\\nDwight looked at Lulu, an upward, sidewise look, with a manner of\\npeering out to see if she meant it. And he saw.\\n\\nHe shrugged, pursed his lips crookedly, rolled his head to signify the\\ninexpressible. \\\"Isn't that like a woman?\\\" he demanded. He rose. \\\"Rather\\nthan let you in for a show of temper,\\\" he said grandly, \\\"I'd do\\nanything.\\\"\\n\\nHe wrote the letter, addressed it, his hand elaborately curved in\\nsecrecy about the envelope, pocketed it.\\n\\n\\\"Ina and I'll walk down with you to mail it,\\\" said Lulu.\\n\\nDwight hesitated, frowned. His Ina watched him with consulting brows.\\n\\n\\\"I was going,\\\" said Dwight, \\\"to propose a little stroll before bedtime.\\\"\\nHe roved about the room. \\\"Where's my beautiful straw hat? There's\\nnothing like a brisk walk to induce sound, restful sleep,\\\" he told them.\\nHe hummed a bar.\\n\\n\\\"You'll be all right, mother?\\\" Lulu asked.\\n\\nMrs. Bett did not look up. \\\"These cardamon hev got a little mite too\\ndry,\\\" she said.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nIn their room, Ina and Dwight discussed the incredible actions of Lulu.\\n\\n\\\"I saw,\\\" said Dwight, \\\"I saw she wasn't herself. I'd do anything to\\navoid having a scene--you know that.\\\" His glance swept a little\\nanxiously his Ina. \\\"You know that, don't you?\\\" he sharply inquired.\\n\\n\\\"But I really think you ought to have written to Ninian about it,\\\" she\\nnow dared to say. \\\"It's--it's not a nice position for Lulu.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nice? Well, but whom has she got to blame for it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, Ninian,\\\" said Ina.\\n\\nDwight threw out his hands. \\\"Herself,\\\" he said. \\\"To tell you the truth,\\nI was perfectly amazed at the way she snapped him up there in that\\nrestaurant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, but, Dwight--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Brazen,\\\" he said. \\\"Oh, it was brazen.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was just fun, in the first place.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But no really nice woman--\\\" he shook his head.\\n\\n\\\"Dwight! Lulu _is_ nice. The idea!\\\"\\n\\nHe regarded her. \\\"Would you have done that?\\\" he would know.\\n\\nUnder his fond look, she softened, took his homage, accepted everything,\\nwas silent.\\n\\n\\\"Certainly not,\\\" he said. \\\"Lulu's tastes are not fine like yours. I\\nshould never think of you as sisters.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She's awfully good,\\\" Ina said feebly. Fifteen years of married life\\nbehind her--but this was sweet and she could not resist.\\n\\n\\\"She has excellent qualities.\\\" He admitted it. \\\"But look at the position\\nshe's in--married to a man who tells her he has another wife in order\\nto get free. Now, no really nice woman--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No really nice man--\\\" Ina did say that much.\\n\\n\\\"Ah,\\\" said Dwight, \\\"but _you_ could never be in such a position. No, no.\\nLulu is sadly lacking somewhere.\\\"\\n\\nIna sighed, threw back her head, caught her lower lip with her upper, as\\nmight be in a hem. \\\"What if it was Di?\\\" she supposed.\\n\\n\\\"Di!\\\" Dwight's look rebuked his wife. \\\"Di,\\\" he said, \\\"was born with\\nladylike feelings.\\\"\\n\\nIt was not yet ten o'clock. Bobby Larkin was permitted to stay until\\nten. From the veranda came the indistinguishable murmur of those young\\nvoices.\\n\\n\\\"Bobby,\\\" Di was saying within that murmur, \\\"Bobby, you don't kiss me as\\nif you really wanted to kiss me, to-night.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\n\\nSEPTEMBER\\n\\nThe office of Dwight Herbert Deacon, Dentist, Gold Work a Speciality\\n(sic) in black lettering, and Justice of the Peace in gold, was above a\\nstore which had been occupied by one unlucky tenant after another, and\\nhad suffered long periods of vacancy when ladies' aid societies served\\nlunches there, under great white signs, badly lettered. Some months of\\ndisuse were now broken by the news that the store had been let to a\\nmusic man. A music man, what on earth was that, Warbleton inquired.\\n\\nThe music man arrived, installed three pianos, and filled his window\\nwith sheet music, as sung by many ladies who swung in hammocks or kissed\\ntheir hands on the music covers. While he was still moving in, Dwight\\nHerbert Deacon wandered downstairs and stood informally in the door of\\nthe new store. The music man, a pleasant-faced chap of thirty-odd, was\\nrubbing at the face of a piano.\\n\\n\\\"Hello, there!\\\" he said. \\\"Can I sell you an upright?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If I can take it out in pulling your teeth, you can,\\\" Dwight replied.\\n\\\"Or,\\\" said he, \\\"I might marry you free, either one.\\\"\\n\\nOn this their friendship began. Thenceforth, when business was dull, the\\nidle hours of both men were beguiled with idle gossip.\\n\\n\\\"How the dickens did you think of pianos for a line?\\\" Dwight asked him\\nonce. \\\"Now, my father was a dentist, so I came by it natural--never\\nentered my head to be anything else. But _pianos_--\\\"\\n\\nThe music man--his name was Neil Cornish--threw up his chin in a boyish\\nfashion, and said he'd be jiggered if he knew. All up and down the\\nWarbleton main street, the chances are that the answer would sound the\\nsame. \\\"I'm studying law when I get the chance,\\\" said Cornish, as one who\\nmakes a bid to be thought of more highly.\\n\\n\\\"I see,\\\" said Dwight, respectfully dwelling on the verb.\\n\\nLater on Cornish confided more to Dwight: He was to come by a little\\ninheritance some day--not much, but something. Yes, it made a man feel a\\ncertain confidence....\\n\\n\\\"_Don't_ it?\\\" said Dwight heartily, as if he knew.\\n\\nEvery one liked Cornish. He told funny stories, and he never compared\\nWarbleton save to its advantage. So at last Dwight said tentatively at\\nlunch:\\n\\n\\\"What if I brought that Neil Cornish up for supper, one of these\\nnights?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Dwightie, do,\\\" said Ina. \\\"If there's a man in town, let's know it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What if I brought him up to-night?\\\"\\n\\nUp went Ina's eyebrows. _To-night_?\\n\\n\\\"'Scalloped potatoes and meat loaf and sauce and bread and butter,\\\"\\nLulu contributed.\\n\\nCornish came to supper. He was what is known in Warbleton as dapper.\\nThis Ina saw as she emerged on the veranda in response to Dwight's\\ninformal halloo on his way upstairs. She herself was in white muslin,\\nnow much too snug, and a blue ribbon. To her greeting their guest\\nreplied in that engaging shyness which is not awkwardness. He moved in\\nsome pleasant web of gentleness and friendliness.\\n\\nThey asked him the usual questions, and he replied, rocking all the time\\nwith a faint undulating motion of head and shoulders: Warbleton was one\\nof the prettiest little towns that he had ever seen. He liked the\\npeople--they seemed different. He was sure to like the place, already\\nliked it. Lulu came to the door in Ninian's thin black-and-white gown.\\nShe shook hands with the stranger, not looking at him, and said, \\\"Come\\nto supper, all.\\\" Monona was already in her place, singing under-breath.\\nMrs. Bett, after hovering in the kitchen door, entered; but they forgot\\nto introduce her.\\n\\n\\\"Where's Di?\\\" asked Ina. \\\"I declare that daughter of mine is never\\nanywhere.\\\"\\n\\nA brief silence ensued as they were seated. There being a guest, grace\\nwas to come, and Dwight said unintelligibly and like lightning a generic\\nappeal to bless this food, forgive all our sins and finally save us. And\\nthere was something tremendous, in this ancient form whereby all stages\\nof men bow in some now unrecognized recognition of the ceremonial of\\ntaking food to nourish life--and more.\\n\\nAt \\\"Amen\\\" Di flashed in, her offices at the mirror fresh upon\\nher--perfect hair, silk dress turned up at the hem. She met Cornish,\\ncrimsoned, fluttered to her seat, joggled the table and, \\\"Oh, dear,\\\" she\\nsaid audibly to her mother, \\\"I forgot my ring.\\\"\\n\\nThe talk was saved alive by a frank effort. Dwight served, making jests\\nabout everybody coming back for more. They went on with Warbleton\\nhappenings, improvements and openings; and the runaway. Cornish tried\\nhard to make himself agreeable, not ingratiatingly but good-naturedly.\\nHe wished profoundly that before coming he had looked up some more\\nstories in the back of the Musical Gazettes. Lulu surreptitiously\\npinched off an ant that was running at large upon the cloth and\\nthereafter kept her eyes steadfastly on the sugar-bowl to see if it\\ncould be from _that_. Dwight pretended that those whom he was helping a\\nsecond time were getting more than their share and facetiously landed on\\nDi about eating so much that she would grow up and be married, first\\nthing she knew. At the word \\\"married\\\" Di turned scarlet, laughed\\nheartily and lifted her glass of water.\\n\\n\\\"And what instruments do you play?\\\" Ina asked Cornish, in an unrelated\\neffort to lift the talk to musical levels.\\n\\n\\\"Well, do you know,\\\" said the music man, \\\"I can't play a thing. Don't\\nknow a black note from a white one.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You don't? Why, Di plays very prettily,\\\" said Di's mother. \\\"But then\\nhow can you tell what songs to order?\\\" Ina cried.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, by the music houses. You go by the sales.\\\" For the first time it\\noccurred to Cornish that this was ridiculous. \\\"You know, I'm really\\nstudying law,\\\" he said, shyly and proudly. Law! How very interesting,\\nfrom Ina. Oh, but won't he bring up some songs some evening, for them to\\ntry over? Her and Di? At this Di laughed and said that she was out of\\npractice and lifted her glass of water. In the presence of adults Di\\nmade one weep, she was so slender, so young, so without defences, so\\nintolerably sensitive to every contact, so in agony lest she be found\\nwanting. It was amazing how unlike was this Di to the Di who had\\nensnared Bobby Larkin. What was one to think?\\n\\nCornish paid very little attention to her. To Lulu he said kindly,\\n\\\"Don't you play, Miss--?\\\" He had not caught her name--no stranger ever\\ndid catch it. But Dwight now supplied it: \\\"Miss Lulu Bett,\\\" he explained\\nwith loud emphasis, and Lulu burned her slow red. This question Lulu had\\nusually answered by telling how a felon had interrupted her lessons and\\nshe had stopped \\\"taking\\\"--a participle sacred to music, in Warbleton.\\nThis vignette had been a kind of epitome of Lulu's biography. But now\\nLulu was heard to say serenely:\\n\\n\\\"No, but I'm quite fond of it. I went to a lovely concert--two weeks\\nago.\\\"\\n\\nThey all listened. Strange indeed to think of Lulu as having had\\nexperiences of which they did not know.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" she said. \\\"It was in Savannah, Georgia.\\\" She flushed, and lifted\\nher eyes in a manner of faint defiance. \\\"Of course,\\\" she said, \\\"I don't\\nknow the names of all the different instruments they played, but there\\nwere a good many.\\\" She laughed pleasantly as a part of her sentence.\\n\\\"They had some lovely tunes,\\\" she said. She knew that the subject was\\nnot exhausted and she hurried on. \\\"The hall was real large,\\\" she\\nsuperadded, \\\"and there were quite a good many people there. And it was\\ntoo warm.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I see,\\\" said Cornish, and said what he had been waiting to say: That he\\ntoo had been in Savannah, Georgia.\\n\\nLulu lit with pleasure. \\\"Well!\\\" she said. And her mind worked and she\\ncaught at the moment before it had escaped. \\\"Isn't it a pretty city?\\\"\\nshe asked. And Cornish assented with the intense heartiness of the\\nprovincial. He, too, it seemed, had a conversational appearance to\\nmaintain by its own effort. He said that he had enjoyed being in that\\ntown and that he was there for two hours.\\n\\n\\\"I was there for a week.\\\" Lulu's superiority was really pretty.\\n\\n\\\"Have good weather?\\\" Cornish selected next.\\n\\nOh, yes. And they saw all the different buildings--but at her \\\"we\\\" she\\nflushed and was silenced. She was colouring and breathing quickly. This\\nwas the first bit of conversation of this sort of Lulu's life.\\n\\nAfter supper Ina inevitably proposed croquet, Dwight pretended to try to\\nescape and, with his irrepressible mien, talked about Ina, elaborate in\\nhis insistence on the third person--\\\"She loves it, we have to humour\\nher, you know how it is. Or no! You don't know! But you will\\\"--and more\\nof the same sort, everybody laughing heartily, save Lulu, who looked\\nuncomfortable and wished that Dwight wouldn't, and Mrs. Bett, who paid\\nno attention to anybody that night, not because she had not been\\nintroduced, an omission, which she had not even noticed, but merely as\\nanother form of \\\"tantrim.\\\" A self-indulgence.\\n\\nThey emerged for croquet. And there on the porch sat Jenny Plow and\\nBobby, waiting for Di to keep an old engagement, which Di pretended to\\nhave forgotten, and to be frightfully annoyed to have to keep. She met\\nthe objections of her parents with all the batteries of her coquetry,\\nset for both Bobby and Cornish and, bold in the presence of \\\"company,\\\"\\nat last went laughing away. And in the minute areas of her consciousness\\nshe said to herself that Bobby would be more in love with her than ever\\nbecause she had risked all to go with him; and that Cornish ought to be\\ndistinctly attracted to her because she had not stayed. She was as\\nprimitive as pollen.\\n\\nIna was vexed. She said so, pouting in a fashion which she should have\\noutgrown with white muslin and blue ribbons, and she had outgrown none\\nof these things.\\n\\n\\\"That just spoils croquet,\\\" she said. \\\"I'm vexed. Now we can't have a\\nreal game.\\\"\\n\\nFrom the side-door, where she must have been lingering among the\\nwaterproofs, Lulu stepped forth.\\n\\n\\\"I'll play a game,\\\" she said.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nWhen Cornish actually proposed to bring some music to the Deacons', Ina\\nturned toward Dwight Herbert all the facets of her responsibility. And\\nIna's sense of responsibility toward Di was enormous, oppressive,\\nprimitive, amounting, in fact, toward this daughter of Dwight Herbert's\\nlate wife, to an ability to compress the offices of stepmotherhood into\\nthe functions of the lecture platform. Ina was a fountain of admonition.\\nHer idea of a daughter, step or not, was that of a manufactured product,\\nstrictly, which you constantly pinched and moulded. She thought that a\\nmoral preceptor had the right to secrete precepts. Di got them all. But\\nof course the crest of Ina's responsibility was to marry Di. This verb\\nshould be transitive only when lovers are speaking of each other, or the\\nminister or magistrate is speaking of lovers. It should never be\\ntransitive when predicated of parents or any other third party. But it\\nis. Ina was quite agitated by its transitiveness as she took to her\\nhusband her incredible responsibility.\\n\\n\\\"You know, Herbert,\\\" said Ina, \\\"if this Mr. Cornish comes here _very_\\nmuch, what we may expect.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What may we expect?\\\" demanded Dwight Herbert, crisply.\\n\\nIna always played his games, answered what he expected her to answer,\\npretended to be intuitive when she was not so, said \\\"I know\\\" when she\\ndidn't know at all. Dwight Herbert, on the other hand, did not even play\\nher games when he knew perfectly what she meant, but pretended not to\\nunderstand, made her repeat, made her explain. It was as if Ina _had_ to\\nplease him for, say, a living; but as for that dentist, he had to please\\nnobody. In the conversations of Dwight and Ina you saw the historical\\nhome forming in clots in the fluid wash of the community.\\n\\n\\\"He'll fall in love with Di,\\\" said Ina.\\n\\n\\\"And what of that? Little daughter will have many a man fall in love\\nwith her, _I_ should say.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, but, Dwight, what do you think of him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do I think of him? My dear Ina, I have other things to think of.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But we don't know anything about him, Dwight--a stranger so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"On the other hand,\\\" said Dwight with dignity, \\\"I know a good deal about\\nhim.\\\"\\n\\nWith a great air of having done the fatherly and found out about this\\nstranger before bringing him into the home, Dwight now related a number\\nof stray circumstances dropped by Cornish in their chance talks.\\n\\n\\\"He has a little inheritance coming to him--shortly,\\\" Dwight wound up.\\n\\n\\\"An inheritance--really? How much, Dwight?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now isn't that like a woman. Isn't it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I _thought_ he was from a good family,\\\" said Ina.\\n\\n\\\"My mercenary little pussy!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" she said with a sigh, \\\"I shouldn't be surprised if Di did really\\naccept him. A young girl is awfully flattered when a good-looking older\\nman pays her attention. Haven't you noticed that?\\\"\\n\\nDwight informed her, with an air of immense abstraction, that he left\\nall such matters to her. Being married to Dwight was like a perpetual\\nrehearsal, with Dwight's self-importance for audience.\\n\\nA few evenings later, Cornish brought up the music. There was something\\noverpowering in this brown-haired chap against the background of his\\nnegligible little shop, his whole capital in his few pianos. For he\\nlooked hopefully ahead, woke with plans, regarded the children in the\\nstreet as if, conceivably, children might come within the confines of\\nhis life as he imagined it. A preposterous little man. And a\\npreposterous store, empty, echoing, bare of wall, the three pianos near\\nthe front, the remainder of the floor stretching away like the corridors\\nof the lost. He was going to get a dark curtain, he explained, and\\nfurnish the back part of the store as his own room. What dignity in\\nphrasing, but how mean that little room would look--cot bed, washbowl\\nand pitcher, and little mirror--almost certainly a mirror with a wavy\\nsurface, almost certainly that.\\n\\n\\\"And then, you know,\\\" he always added, \\\"I'm reading law.\\\"\\n\\nThe Plows had been asked in that evening. Bobby was there. They were,\\nDwight Herbert said, going to have a sing.\\n\\nDi was to play. And Di was now embarked on the most difficult feat of\\nher emotional life, the feat of remaining to Bobby Larkin the lure, the\\nbeloved lure, the while to Cornish she instinctively played the r\\u00f4le of\\nwomanly little girl.\\n\\n\\\"Up by the festive lamp, everybody!\\\" Dwight Herbert cried.\\n\\nAs they gathered about the upright piano, that startled, Dwightish\\ninstrument, standing in its attitude of unrest, Lulu came in with\\nanother lamp.\\n\\n\\\"Do you need this?\\\" she asked.\\n\\nThey did not need it, there was, in fact, no place to set it, and this\\nLulu must have known. But Dwight found a place. He swept Ninian's\\nphotograph from the marble shelf of the mirror, and when Lulu had placed\\nthe lamp there, Dwight thrust the photograph into her hands.\\n\\n\\\"You take care of that,\\\" he said, with a droop of lid discernible only\\nto those who--presumably--loved him. His old attitude toward Lulu had\\nshown a terrible sharpening in these ten days since her return.\\n\\nShe stood uncertainly, in the thin black and white gown which Ninian had\\nbought for her, and held Ninian's photograph and looked helplessly\\nabout. She was moving toward the door when Cornish called:\\n\\n\\\"See here! Aren't _you_ going to sing?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What?\\\" Dwight used the falsetto. \\\"Lulu sing? _Lulu_?\\\"\\n\\nShe stood awkwardly. She had a piteous recrudescence of her old agony at\\nbeing spoken to in the presence of others. But Di had opened the \\\"Album\\nof Old Favourites,\\\" which Cornish had elected to bring, and now she\\nstruck the opening chords of \\\"Bonny Eloise.\\\" Lulu stood still, looking\\nrather piteously at Cornish. Dwight offered his arm, absurdly crooked.\\nThe Plows and Ina and Di began to sing. Lulu moved forward, and stood a\\nlittle away from them, and sang, too. She was still holding Ninian's\\npicture. Dwight did not sing. He lifted his shoulders and his eyebrows\\nand watched Lulu.\\n\\nWhen they had finished, \\\"Lulu the mocking bird!\\\" Dwight cried. He said\\n\\\"ba-ird.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Fine!\\\" cried Cornish. \\\"Why, Miss Lulu, you have a good voice!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Miss Lulu Bett, the mocking ba-ird!\\\" Dwight insisted.\\n\\nLulu was excited, and in some accession of faint power. She turned to\\nhim now, quietly, and with a look of appraisal.\\n\\n\\\"Lulu the dove,\\\" she then surprisingly said, \\\"to put up with you.\\\"\\n\\nIt was her first bit of conscious repartee to her brother-in-law.\\n\\nCornish was bending over Di.\\n\\n\\\"What next do you say?\\\" he asked.\\n\\nShe lifted her eyes, met his own, held them. \\\"There's such a lovely,\\nlovely sacred song here,\\\" she suggested, and looked down.\\n\\n\\\"You like sacred music?\\\"\\n\\nShe turned to him her pure profile, her eyelids fluttering up, and said:\\n\\\"I love it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's it. So do I. Nothing like a nice sacred piece,\\\" Cornish\\ndeclared.\\n\\nBobby Larkin, at the end of the piano, looked directly into Di's face.\\n\\n\\\"Give _me_ ragtime,\\\" he said now, with the effect of bursting out of\\nsomewhere. \\\"Don't you like ragtime?\\\" he put it to her directly.\\n\\nDi's eyes danced into his, they sparkled for him, her smile was a smile\\nfor him alone, all their store of common memories was in their look.\\n\\n\\\"Let's try 'My Rock, My Refuge,'\\\" Cornish suggested. \\\"That's got up real\\nattractive.\\\"\\n\\nDi's profile again, and her pleased voice saying that this was the very\\none she had been hoping to hear him sing.\\n\\nThey gathered for \\\"My Rock, My Refuge.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" cried Ina, at the conclusion of this number, \\\"I'm having such a\\nperfectly beautiful time. Isn't everybody?\\\" everybody's hostess put it.\\n\\n\\\"Lulu is,\\\" said Dwight, and added softly to Lulu: \\\"She don't have to\\nhear herself sing.\\\"\\n\\nIt was incredible. He was like a bad boy with a frog. About that\\nphotograph of Ninian he found a dozen ways to torture her, called\\nattention to it, showed it to Cornish, set it on the piano facing them\\nall. Everybody must have understood--excepting the Plows. These two\\ngentle souls sang placidly through the Album of Old Favourites, and at\\nthe melodies smiled happily upon each other with an air from another\\nworld. Always it was as if the Plows walked some fair, inter-penetrating\\nplane, from which they looked out as do other things not quite of\\nearth, say, flowers and fire and music.\\n\\nStrolling home that night, the Plows were overtaken by some one who ran\\nbadly, and as if she were unaccustomed to running.\\n\\n\\\"Mis' Plow, Mis' Plow!\\\" this one called, and Lulu stood beside them.\\n\\n\\\"Say!\\\" she said. \\\"Do you know of any job that I could get me? I mean\\nthat I'd know how to do? A job for money.... I mean a job....\\\"\\n\\nShe burst into passionate crying. They drew her home with them.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nLying awake sometime after midnight, Lulu heard the telephone ring. She\\nheard Dwight's concerned \\\"Is that so?\\\" And his cheerful \\\"Be right\\nthere.\\\"\\n\\nGrandma Gates was sick, she heard him tell Ina. In a few moments he ran\\ndown the stairs. Next day they told how Dwight had sat for hours that\\nnight, holding Grandma Gates so that her back would rest easily and she\\ncould fight for her faint breath. The kind fellow had only about two\\nhours of sleep the whole night long.\\n\\nNext day there came a message from that woman who had brought up\\nDwight--\\\"made him what he was,\\\" he often complacently accused her. It\\nwas a note on a postal card--she had often written a few lines on a\\npostal card to say that she had sent the maple sugar, or could Ina get\\nher some samples. Now she wrote a few lines on a postal card to say that\\nshe was going to die with cancer. Could Dwight and Ina come to her while\\nshe was still able to visit? If he was not too busy....\\n\\nNobody saw the pity and the terror of that postal card. They stuck it up\\nby the kitchen clock to read over from time to time, and before they\\nleft, Dwight lifted the griddle of the cooking-stove and burned the\\npostal card.\\n\\nAnd before they left Lulu said: \\\"Dwight--you can't tell how long you'll\\nbe gone?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course not. How should I tell?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. And that letter might come while you're away.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Conceivably. Letters do come while a man's away!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dwight--I thought if you wouldn't mind if I opened it--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Opened it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. You see, it'll be about me mostly--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should have said that it'll be about my brother mostly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you know what I mean. You wouldn't mind if I did open it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you say you know what'll be in it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So I did know--till you--I've got to see that letter, Dwight.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And so you shall. But not till I show it to you. My dear Lulu, you know\\nhow I hate having my mail interfered with.\\\"\\n\\nShe might have said: \\\"Small souls always make a point of that.\\\" She said\\nnothing. She watched them set off, and kept her mind on Ina's thousand\\ninjunctions.\\n\\n\\\"Don't let Di see much of Bobby Larkin. And, Lulu--if it occurs to her\\nto have Mr. Cornish come up to sing, of course you ask him. You might\\nask him to supper. And don't let mother overdo. And, Lulu, now do watch\\nMonona's handkerchief--the child will never take a clean one if I'm not\\nhere to tell her....\\\"\\n\\nShe breathed injunctions to the very step of the 'bus.\\n\\nIn the 'bus Dwight leaned forward:\\n\\n\\\"See that you play post-office squarely, Lulu!\\\" he called, and threw\\nback his head and lifted his eyebrows.\\n\\nIn the train he turned tragic eyes to his wife.\\n\\n\\\"Ina,\\\" he said. \\\"It's _ma_. And she's going to die. It can't be....\\\"\\n\\nIna said: \\\"But you're going to help her, Dwight, just being there with\\nher.\\\"\\n\\nIt was true that the mere presence of the man would bring a kind of\\nfresh life to that worn frame. Tact and wisdom and love would speak\\nthrough him and minister.\\n\\nToward the end of their week's absence the letter from Ninian came.\\n\\nLulu took it from the post-office when she went for the mail that\\nevening, dressed in her dark red gown. There was no other letter, and\\nshe carried that one letter in her hand all through the streets. She\\npassed those who were surmising what her story might be, who were\\ntelling one another what they had heard. But she knew hardly more than\\nthey. She passed Cornish in the doorway of his little music shop, and\\nspoke with him; and there was the letter. It was so that Dwight's foster\\nmother's postal card might have looked on its way to be mailed.\\n\\nCornish stepped down and overtook her.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Miss Lulu. I've got a new song or two--\\\"\\n\\nShe said abstractedly: \\\"Do. Any night. To-morrow night--could you--\\\" It\\nwas as if Lulu were too preoccupied to remember to be ill at ease.\\n\\nCornish flushed with pleasure, said that he could indeed.\\n\\n\\\"Come for supper,\\\" Lulu said.\\n\\nOh, could he? Wouldn't that be.... Well, say! Such was his acceptance.\\n\\nHe came for supper. And Di was not at home. She had gone off in the\\ncountry with Jenny and Bobby, and they merely did not return.\\n\\nMrs. Bett and Lulu and Cornish and Monona supped alone. All were at\\nease, now that they were alone. Especially Mrs. Bett was at ease. It\\nbecame one of her young nights, her alive and lucid nights. She was\\n_there_. She sat in Dwight's chair and Lulu sat in Ina's chair. Lulu had\\npicked flowers for the table--a task coveted by her but usually\\nperformed by Ina. Lulu had now picked Sweet William and had filled a\\nvase of silver gilt taken from the parlour. Also, Lulu had made\\nice-cream.\\n\\n\\\"I don't see what Di can be thinking of,\\\" Lulu said. \\\"It seems like\\nasking you under false--\\\" She was afraid of \\\"pretences\\\" and ended\\nwithout it.\\n\\nCornish savoured his steaming beef pie, with sage. \\\"Oh, well!\\\" he said\\ncontentedly.\\n\\n\\\"Kind of a relief, _I_ think, to have her gone,\\\" said Mrs. Bett, from\\nthe fulness of something or other.\\n\\n\\\"Mother!\\\" Lulu said, twisting her smile.\\n\\n\\\"Why, my land, I love her,\\\" Mrs. Bett explained, \\\"but she wiggles and\\nchitters.\\\"\\n\\nCornish never made the slightest effort, at any time, to keep a straight\\nface. The honest fellow now laughed loudly.\\n\\n\\\"Well!\\\" Lulu thought. \\\"He can't be so _very_ much in love.\\\" And again\\nshe thought: \\\"He doesn't know anything about the letter. He thinks\\nNinian got tired of me.\\\" Deep in her heart there abode her certainty\\nthat this was not so.\\n\\nBy some etiquette of consent, Mrs. Bett cleared the table and Lulu and\\nCornish went into the parlour. There lay the letter on the drop-leaf\\nside-table, among the shells. Lulu had carried it there, where she need\\nnot see it at her work. The letter looked no more than the advertisement\\nof dental office furniture beneath it. Monona stood indifferently\\nfingering both.\\n\\n\\\"Monona,\\\" Lulu said sharply, \\\"leave them be!\\\"\\n\\nCornish was displaying his music. \\\"Got up quite attractive,\\\" he said--it\\nwas his formula of praise for his music.\\n\\n\\\"But we can't try it over,\\\" Lulu said, \\\"if Di doesn't come.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, say,\\\" said Cornish shyly, \\\"you know I left that Album of Old\\nFavourites here. Some of them we know by heart.\\\"\\n\\nLulu looked. \\\"I'll tell you something,\\\" she said, \\\"there's some of these\\nI can play with one hand--by ear. Maybe--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why sure!\\\" said Cornish.\\n\\nLulu sat at the piano. She had on the wool chally, long sacred to the\\nnights when she must combine her servant's estate with the quality of\\nbeing Ina's sister. She wore her coral beads and her cameo cross. In\\nher absence she had caught the trick of dressing her hair so that it\\nlooked even more abundant--but she had not dared to try it so until\\nto-night, when Dwight was gone. Her long wrist was curved high, her thin\\nhand pressed and fingered awkwardly, and at her mistakes her head dipped\\nand strove to make all right. Her foot continuously touched the loud\\npedal--the blurred sound seemed to accomplish more. So she played \\\"How\\nCan I Leave Thee,\\\" and they managed to sing it. So she played \\\"Long,\\nLong Ago,\\\" and \\\"Little Nell of Narragansett Bay.\\\" Beyond open doors,\\nMrs. Bett listened, sang, it may be, with them; for when the singers\\nceased, her voice might be heard still humming a loud closing bar.\\n\\n\\\"Well!\\\" Cornish cried to Lulu; and then, in the formal village phrase:\\n\\\"You're quite a musician.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no!\\\" Lulu disclaimed it. She looked up, flushed, smiling. \\\"I've\\nnever done this in front of anybody,\\\" she owned. \\\"I don't know what\\nDwight and Ina'd say....\\\" She drooped.\\n\\nThey rested, and, miraculously, the air of the place had stirred and\\nquickened, as if the crippled, halting melody had some power of its own,\\nand poured this forth, even thus trampled.\\n\\n\\\"I guess you could do 'most anything you set your hand to,\\\" said\\nCornish.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no,\\\" Lulu said again.\\n\\n\\\"Sing and play and cook--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I can't earn anything. I'd like to earn something.\\\" But this she\\nhad not meant to say. She stopped, rather frightened.\\n\\n\\\"You would! Why, you have it fine here, I thought.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, fine, yes. Dwight gives me what I have. And I do their work.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I see,\\\" said Cornish. \\\"I never thought of that,\\\" he added. She caught\\nhis speculative look--he had heard a tale or two concerning her return,\\nas who in Warbleton had not heard?\\n\\n\\\"You're wondering why I didn't stay with him!\\\" Lulu said recklessly.\\nThis was no less than wrung from her, but its utterance occasioned in\\nher an unspeakable relief.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no,\\\" Cornish disclaimed, and coloured and rocked.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, you are,\\\" she swept on. \\\"The whole town's wondering. Well, I'd\\nlike 'em to know, but Dwight won't let me tell.\\\"\\n\\nCornish frowned, trying to understand.\\n\\n\\\"'Won't let you!'\\\" he repeated. \\\"I should say that was your own affair.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. Not when Dwight gives me all I have.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, that--\\\" said Cornish. \\\"That's not right.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. But there it is. It puts me--you see what it does to me. They\\nthink--they all think my--husband left me.\\\"\\n\\nIt was curious to hear her bring out that word--tentatively,\\ndeprecatingly, like some one daring a foreign phrase without warrant.\\n\\nCornish said feebly: \\\"Oh, well....\\\"\\n\\nBefore she willed it, she was telling him:\\n\\n\\\"He didn't. He didn't leave me,\\\" she cried with passion. \\\"He had another\\nwife.\\\" Incredibly it was as if she were defending both him and herself.\\n\\n\\\"Lord sakes!\\\" said Cornish.\\n\\nShe poured it out, in her passion to tell some one, to share her news of\\nher state where there would be neither hardness nor censure.\\n\\n\\\"We were in Savannah, Georgia,\\\" she said. \\\"We were going to leave for\\nOregon--going to go through California. We were in the hotel, and he was\\ngoing out to get the tickets. He started to go. Then he came back. I was\\nsitting the same as there. He opened the door again--the same as here. I\\nsaw he looked different--and he said quick: 'There's something you'd\\nought to know before we go.' And of course I said, 'What?' And he said\\nit right out--how he was married eighteen years ago and in two years she\\nran away and she must be dead but he wasn't sure. He hadn't the proofs.\\nSo of course I came home. But it wasn't him left me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no. Of course he didn't,\\\" Cornish said earnestly. \\\"But Lord\\nsakes--\\\" he said again. He rose to walk about, found it impracticable\\nand sat down.\\n\\n\\\"That's what Dwight don't want me to tell--he thinks it isn't true. He\\nthinks--he didn't have any other wife. He thinks he wanted--\\\" Lulu\\nlooked up at him.\\n\\n\\\"You see,\\\" she said, \\\"Dwight thinks he didn't want me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But why don't you make your--husband--I mean, why doesn't he write to\\nMr. Deacon here, and tell him the truth--\\\" Cornish burst out.\\n\\nUnder this implied belief, she relaxed and into her face came its rare\\nsweetness.\\n\\n\\\"He has written,\\\" she said. \\\"The letter's there.\\\"\\n\\nHe followed her look, scowled at the two letters.\\n\\n\\\"What'd he say?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dwight don't like me to touch his mail. I'll have to wait till he\\ncomes back.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lord sakes!\\\" said Cornish.\\n\\nThis time he did rise and walk about. He wanted to say something, wanted\\nit with passion. He paused beside Lulu and stammered: \\\"You--you--you're\\ntoo nice a girl to get a deal like this. Darned if you aren't.\\\"\\n\\nTo her own complete surprise Lulu's eyes filled with tears, and she\\ncould not speak. She was by no means above self-sympathy.\\n\\n\\\"And there ain't,\\\" said Cornish sorrowfully, \\\"there ain't a thing I can\\ndo.\\\"\\n\\nAnd yet he was doing much. He was gentle, he was listening, and on his\\nface a frown of concern. His face continually surprised her, it was so\\nfine and alive and near, by comparison with Ninian's loose-lipped,\\nruddy, impersonal look and Dwight's thin, high-boned hardness. All the\\ntime Cornish gave her something, instead of drawing upon her. Above all,\\nhe was there, and she could talk to him.\\n\\n\\\"It's--it's funny,\\\" Lulu said. \\\"I'd be awful glad if I just _could_\\nknow for sure that the other woman was alive--if I couldn't know she's\\ndead.\\\"\\n\\nThis surprising admission Cornish seemed to understand.\\n\\n\\\"Sure you would,\\\" he said briefly.\\n\\n\\\"Cora Waters,\\\" Lulu said. \\\"Cora Waters, of San Diego, California. And\\nshe never heard of me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" Cornish admitted. They stared at each other as across some abyss.\\n\\nIn the doorway Mrs. Bett appeared.\\n\\n\\\"I scraped up everything,\\\" she remarked, \\\"and left the dishes set.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's right, mamma,\\\" Lulu said. \\\"Come and sit down.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Bett entered with a leisurely air of doing the thing next expected\\nof her.\\n\\n\\\"I don't hear any more playin' and singin',\\\" she remarked. \\\"It sounded\\nreal nice.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We--we sung all I knew how to play, I guess, mamma.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I use' to play on the melodeon,\\\" Mrs. Bett volunteered, and spread and\\nexamined her right hand.\\n\\n\\\"Well!\\\" said Cornish.\\n\\nShe now told them about her log-house in a New England clearing, when\\nshe was a bride. All her store of drama and life came from her. She\\nrehearsed it with far eyes. She laughed at old delights, drooped at old\\nfears. She told about her little daughter who had died at sixteen--a\\ntragedy such as once would have been renewed in a vital ballad. At the\\nend she yawned frankly as if, in some terrible sophistication, she had\\nbeen telling the story of some one else.\\n\\n\\\"Give us one more piece,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Can we?\\\" Cornish asked.\\n\\n\\\"I can play 'I Think When I Read That Sweet Story of Old,'\\\" Lulu said.\\n\\n\\\"That's the ticket!\\\" cried Cornish.\\n\\nThey sang it, to Lulu's right hand.\\n\\n\\\"That's the one you picked out when you was a little girl, Lulie,\\\"\\ncried, Mrs. Bett.\\n\\nLulu had played it now as she must have played it then.\\n\\nHalf after nine and Di had not returned. But nobody thought of Di.\\nCornish rose to go.\\n\\n\\\"What's them?\\\" Mrs. Bett demanded.\\n\\n\\\"Dwight's letters, mamma. You mustn't touch them!\\\" Lulu's voice was\\nsharp.\\n\\n\\\"Say!\\\" Cornish, at the door, dropped his voice. \\\"If there was anything I\\ncould do at any time, you'd let me know, wouldn't you?\\\"\\n\\nThat past tense, those subjunctives, unconsciously called upon her to\\nfeel no intrusion.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, thank you,\\\" she said. \\\"You don't know how good it is to feel--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course it is,\\\" said Cornish heartily.\\n\\nThey stood for a moment on the porch. The night was one of low clamour\\nfrom the grass, tiny voices, insisting.\\n\\n\\\"Of course,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"of course you won't--you wouldn't--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Say anything?\\\" he divined. \\\"Not for dollars. Not,\\\" he repeated, \\\"for\\ndollars.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I knew you wouldn't,\\\" she told him.\\n\\nHe took her hand. \\\"Good-night,\\\" he said. \\\"I've had an awful nice time\\nsinging and listening to you talk--well, of course--I mean,\\\" he cried,\\n\\\"the supper was just fine. And so was the music.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no,\\\" she said.\\n\\nMrs. Bett came into the hall.\\n\\n\\\"Lulie,\\\" she said, \\\"I guess you didn't notice--this one's from Ninian.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mother--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I opened it--why, of course I did. It's from Ninian.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Bett held out the opened envelope, the unfolded letter, and a\\nyellowed newspaper clipping.\\n\\n\\\"See,\\\" said the old woman, \\\"says, 'Corie Waters, music hall\\nsinger--married last night to Ninian Deacon--' Say, Lulie, that must be\\nher....\\\"\\n\\nLulu threw out her hands.\\n\\n\\\"There!\\\" she cried triumphantly. \\\"He _was_ married to her, just like he\\nsaid!\\\"\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nThe Plows were at breakfast next morning when Lulu came in casually at\\nthe side-door. Yes, she said, she had had breakfast. She merely wanted\\nto see them about something. Then she said nothing, but sat looking with\\na troubled frown at Jenny. Jenny's hair was about her neck, like the\\nhair of a little girl, a south window poured light upon her, the fruit\\nand honey upon the table seemed her only possible food.\\n\\n\\\"You look troubled, Lulu,\\\" Mrs. Plow said. \\\"Is it about getting work?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"no. I've been places to ask--quite a lot of places. I\\nguess the bakery is going to let me make cake.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I knew it would come to you,\\\" Mrs. Plow said, and Lulu thought that\\nthis was a strange way to speak, when she herself had gone after the\\ncakes. But she kept on looking about the room. It was so bright and\\nquiet. As she came in, Mr. Plow had been reading from a book. Dwight\\nnever read from a book at table.\\n\\n\\\"I wish----\\\" said Lulu, as she looked at them. But she did not know what\\nshe wished. Certainly it was for no moral excellence, for she perceived\\nnone.\\n\\n\\\"What is it, Lulu?\\\" Mr. Plow asked, and he was bright and quiet too,\\nLulu thought.\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"it's not much. But I wanted Jenny to tell me about\\nlast night.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Last night?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. Would you----\\\" Hesitation was her only way of apology. \\\"Where did\\nyou go?\\\" She turned to Jenny.\\n\\nJenny looked up in her clear and ardent fashion: \\\"We went across the\\nriver and carried supper and then we came home.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What time did you get home?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, it was still light. Long before eight, it was.\\\"\\n\\nLulu hesitated and flushed, asked how long Di and Bobby had stayed there\\nat Jenny's; whereupon she heard that Di had to be home early on account\\nof Mr. Cornish, so that she and Bobby had not stayed at all. To which\\nLulu said an \\\"of course,\\\" but first she stared at Jenny and so impaired\\nthe strength of her assent. Almost at once she rose to go.\\n\\n\\\"Nothing else?\\\" said Mrs. Plow, catching that look of hers.\\n\\nLulu wanted to say: \\\"My husband _was_ married before, just as he said he\\nwas.\\\" But she said nothing more, and went home. There she put it to Di,\\nand with her terrible bluntness reviewed to Di the testimony.\\n\\n\\\"You were not with Jenny after eight o'clock. Where were you?\\\" Lulu\\nspoke formally and her rehearsals were evident.\\n\\nDi said: \\\"When mamma comes home, I'll tell her.\\\"\\n\\nWith this Lulu had no idea how to deal, and merely looked at her\\nhelplessly. Mrs. Bett, who was lacing her shoes, now said casually:\\n\\n\\\"No need to wait till then. Her and Bobby were out in the side yard\\nsitting in the hammock till all hours.\\\"\\n\\nDi had no answer save her furious flush, and Mrs. Bett went on:\\n\\n\\\"Didn't I tell you? I knew it before the company left, but I didn't say\\na word. Thinks I, 'She's wiggles and chitters.' So I left her stay where\\nshe was.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, mother!\\\" Lulu cried. \\\"You didn't even tell me after he'd gone.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I forgot it,\\\" Mrs. Bett said, \\\"finding Ninian's letter and all--\\\" She\\ntalked of Ninian's letter.\\n\\nDi was bright and alert and firm of flesh and erect before Lulu's\\nsoftness and laxness.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know what your mother'll say,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"and I don't know\\nwhat people'll think.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They won't think Bobby and I are tired of each other, anyway,\\\" said Di,\\nand left the room.\\n\\nThrough the day Lulu tried to think what she must do. About Di she was\\nanxious and felt without power. She thought of the indignation of Dwight\\nand Ina that Di had not been more scrupulously guarded. She thought of\\nDi's girlish folly, her irritating independence--\\\"and there,\\\" Lulu\\nthought, \\\"just the other day I was teaching her to sew.\\\" Her mind dwelt\\ntoo on Dwight's furious anger at the opening of Ninian's letter. But\\nwhen all this had spent itself, what was she herself to do? She must\\nleave his house before he ordered her to do so, when she told him that\\nshe had confided in Cornish, as tell she must. But what was she to _do_?\\nThe bakery cake-making would not give her a roof.\\n\\nStepping about the kitchen in her blue cotton gown, her hair tight and\\nflat as seemed proper when one was not dressed, she thought about these\\nthings. And it was strange: Lulu bore no physical appearance of one in\\ndistress or any anxiety. Her head was erect, her movements were strong\\nand swift, her eyes were interested. She was no drooping Lulu with\\ndragging step. She was more intent, she was somehow more operative than\\nshe had ever been.\\n\\nMrs. Bett was working contentedly beside her, and now and then humming\\nan air of that music of the night before. The sun surged through the\\nkitchen door and east window, a returned oriole swung and fluted on the\\nelm above the gable. Wagons clattered by over the rattling wooden block\\npavement.\\n\\n\\\"Ain't it nice with nobody home?\\\" Mrs. Bett remarked at intervals, like\\nthe burden of a comic song.\\n\\n\\\"Hush, mother,\\\" Lulu said, troubled, her ethical refinements conflicting\\nwith her honesty.\\n\\n\\\"Speak the truth and shame the devil,\\\" Mrs. Bett contended.\\n\\nWhen dinner was ready at noon, Di did not appear. A little earlier Lulu\\nhad heard her moving about her room, and she served her in expectation\\nthat she would join them.\\n\\n\\\"Di must be having the 'tantrim' this time,\\\" she thought, and for a time\\nsaid nothing. But at length she did say: \\\"Why doesn't Di come? I'd\\nbetter put her plate in the oven.\\\"\\n\\nRising to do so, she was arrested by her mother. Mrs. Bett was eating a\\nbaked potato, holding her fork close to the tines, and presenting a\\nprofile of passionate absorption.\\n\\n\\\"Why, Di went off,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Went off!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Down the walk. Down the sidewalk.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She must have gone to Jenny's,\\\" said Lulu. \\\"I wish she wouldn't do that\\nwithout telling me.\\\"\\n\\nMonona laughed out and shook her straight hair. \\\"She'll catch it!\\\" she\\ncried in sisterly enjoyment.\\n\\nIt was when Lulu had come back from the kitchen and was seated at the\\ntable that Mrs. Bett observed:\\n\\n\\\"I didn't think Inie'd want her to take her nice new satchel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Her satchel?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. Inie wouldn't take it north herself, but Di had it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mother,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"when Di went away just now, was she carrying a\\nsatchel?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Didn't I just tell you?\\\" Mrs. Bett demanded, aggrieved. \\\"I said I\\ndidn't think Inie--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mother! Which way did she go?\\\"\\n\\nMonona pointed with her spoon. \\\"She went that way,\\\" she said. \\\"I seen\\nher.\\\"\\n\\nLulu looked at the clock. For Monona had pointed toward the railway\\nstation. The twelve-thirty train, which every one took to the city for\\nshopping, would be just about leaving.\\n\\n\\\"Monona,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"don't you go out of the yard while I'm gone.\\nMother, you keep her--\\\"\\n\\nLulu ran from the house and up the street. She was in her blue cotton\\ndress, her old shoes, she was hatless and without money. When she was\\nstill two or three blocks from the station, she heard the twelve-thirty\\n\\\"pulling out.\\\"\\n\\nShe ran badly, her ankles in their low, loose shoes continually turning,\\nher arms held taut at her sides. So she came down the platform, and to\\nthe ticket window. The contained ticket man, wonted to lost trains and\\nperturbed faces, yet actually ceased counting when he saw her:\\n\\n\\\"Lenny! Did Di Deacon take that train?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sure she did,\\\" said Lenny.\\n\\n\\\"And Bobby Larkin?\\\" Lulu cared nothing for appearances now.\\n\\n\\\"He went in on the Local,\\\" said Lenny, and his eyes widened.\\n\\n\\\"Where?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"See.\\\" Lenny thought it through. \\\"Millton,\\\" he said. \\\"Yes, sure.\\nMillton. Both of 'em.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How long till another train?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, sir,\\\" said the ticket man, \\\"you're in luck, if you was goin' too.\\nSeventeen was late this morning--she'll be along, jerk of a lamb's\\ntail.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"you got to give me a ticket to Millton, without me\\npaying till after--and you got to lend me two dollars.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sure thing,\\\" said Lenny, with a manner of laying the entire railway\\nsystem at her feet.\\n\\n\\\"Seventeen\\\" would rather not have stopped at Warbleton, but Lenny's\\nsignal was law on the time card, and the magnificent yellow express\\nslowed down for Lulu. Hatless and in her blue cotton gown, she climbed\\naboard.\\n\\nThen her old inefficiency seized upon her. What was she going to do?\\nMillton! She had been there but once, years ago--how could she ever\\nfind anybody? Why had she not stayed in Warbleton and asked the sheriff\\nor somebody--no, not the sheriff. Cornish, perhaps. Oh, and Dwight and\\nIna were going to be angry now! And Di--little Di. As Lulu thought of\\nher she began to cry. She said to herself that she had taught Di to\\nsew.\\n\\nIn sight of Millton, Lulu was seized with trembling and physical nausea.\\nShe had never been alone in any unfamiliar town. She put her hands to\\nher hair and for the first time realized her rolled-up sleeves. She was\\npulling down these sleeves when the conductor came through the train.\\n\\n\\\"Could you tell me,\\\" she said timidly, \\\"the name of the principal hotel\\nin Millton?\\\"\\n\\nNinian had asked this as they neared Savannah, Georgia.\\n\\nThe conductor looked curiously at her.\\n\\n\\\"Why, the Hess House,\\\" he said. \\\"Wasn't you expecting anybody to meet\\nyou?\\\" he asked, kindly.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"but I'm going to find my folks--\\\" Her voice trailed\\naway.\\n\\n\\\"Beats all,\\\" thought the conductor, using his utility formula for the\\nuniverse.\\n\\nIn Millton Lulu's inquiry for the Hess House produced no consternation.\\nNobody paid any attention to her. She was almost certainly taken to be a\\nnew servant there.\\n\\n\\\"You stop feeling so!\\\" she said to herself angrily at the lobby\\nentrance. \\\"Ain't you been to that big hotel in Savannah, Georgia?\\\"\\n\\nThe Hess House, Millton, had a tradition of its own to maintain, it\\nseemed, and they sent her to the rear basement door. She obeyed meekly,\\nbut she lost a good deal of time before she found herself at the end of\\nthe office desk. It was still longer before any one attended her.\\n\\n\\\"Please, sir!\\\" she burst out. \\\"See if Di Deacon has put her name on your\\nbook.\\\"\\n\\nHer appeal was tremendous, compelling. The young clerk listened to her,\\nshowed her where to look in the register. When only strange names and\\nstrange writing presented themselves there, he said:\\n\\n\\\"Tried the parlour?\\\"\\n\\nAnd directed her kindly and with his thumb, and in the other hand a pen\\ndivorced from his ear for the express purpose.\\n\\nIn crossing the lobby in the hotel at Savannah, Georgia, Lulu's most\\npressing problem had been to know where to look. But now the idlers in\\nthe Hess House lobby did not exist. In time she found the door of the\\nintensely rose-coloured reception room. There, in a fat, rose-coloured\\nchair, beside a cataract of lace curtain, sat Di, alone.\\n\\nLulu entered. She had no idea what to say. When Di looked up, started\\nup, frowned, Lulu felt as if she herself were the culprit. She said the\\nfirst thing that occurred to her:\\n\\n\\\"I don't believe mamma'll like your taking her nice satchel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well!\\\" said Di, exactly as if she had been at home. And superadded: \\\"My\\ngoodness!\\\" And then cried rudely: \\\"What are you here for?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For you,\\\" said Lulu. \\\"You--you--you'd ought not to be here, Di.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What's that to you?\\\" Di cried.\\n\\n\\\"Why, Di, you're just a little girl----\\\"\\n\\nLulu saw that this was all wrong, and stopped miserably. How was she to\\ngo on? \\\"Di,\\\" she said, \\\"if you and Bobby want to get married, why not\\nlet us get you up a nice wedding at home?\\\" And she saw that this sounded\\nas if she were talking about a tea-party.\\n\\n\\\"Who said we wanted to be married?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, he's here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who said he's here?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Isn't he?\\\"\\n\\nDi sprang up. \\\"Aunt Lulu,\\\" she said, \\\"you're a funny person to be\\ntelling _me_ what to do.\\\"\\n\\nLulu said, flushing: \\\"I love you just the same as if I was married\\nhappy, in a home.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, you aren't!\\\" cried Di cruelly, \\\"and I'm going to do just as I\\nthink best.\\\"\\n\\nLulu thought this over, her look grave and sad. She tried to find\\nsomething to say. \\\"What do people say to people,\\\" she wondered, \\\"when\\nit's like this?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Getting married is for your whole life,\\\" was all that came to her.\\n\\n\\\"Yours wasn't,\\\" Di flashed at her.\\n\\nLulu's colour deepened, but there seemed to be no resentment in her. She\\nmust deal with this right--that was what her manner seemed to say. And\\nhow should she deal?\\n\\n\\\"Di,\\\" she cried, \\\"come back with me--and wait till mamma and papa get\\nhome.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's likely. They say I'm not to be married till I'm twenty-one.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, but how young that is!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Di! This is wrong--it _is_ wrong.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There's nothing wrong about getting married--if you stay married.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, then it can't be wrong to let them know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It isn't. But they'd treat me wrong. They'd make me stay at home. And I\\nwon't stay at home--I won't stay there. They act as if I was ten years\\nold.\\\"\\n\\nAbruptly in Lulu's face there came a light of understanding.\\n\\n\\\"Why, Di,\\\" she said, \\\"do you feel that way too?\\\"\\n\\nDi missed this. She went on:\\n\\n\\\"I'm grown up. I feel just as grown up as they do. And I'm not allowed\\nto do a thing I feel. I want to be away--I will be away!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know about that part,\\\" Lulu said.\\n\\nShe now looked at Di with attention. Was it possible that Di was\\nsuffering in the air of that home as she herself suffered? She had not\\nthought of that. There Di had seemed so young, so dependent,\\nso--asquirm. Here, by herself, waiting for Bobby, in the Hess House at\\nMillton, she was curiously adult. Would she be adult if she were let\\nalone?\\n\\n\\\"You don't know what it's like,\\\" Di cried, \\\"to be hushed up and laughed\\nat and paid no attention to, everything you say.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't I?\\\" said Lulu. \\\"Don't I?\\\"\\n\\nShe was breathing quickly and looking at Di. If _this_ was why Di was\\nleaving home....\\n\\n\\\"But, Di,\\\" she cried, \\\"do you love Bobby Larkin?\\\"\\n\\nBy this Di was embarrassed. \\\"I've got to marry somebody,\\\" she said, \\\"and\\nit might as well be him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But is it him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, it is,\\\" said Di. \\\"But,\\\" she added, \\\"I know I could love almost\\nanybody real nice that was nice to me.\\\" And this she said, not in her\\nown right, but either she had picked it up somewhere and adopted it, or\\nelse the terrible modernity and honesty of her day somehow spoke through\\nher, for its own. But to Lulu it was as if something familiar turned its\\nface to be recognised.\\n\\n\\\"Di!\\\" she cried.\\n\\n\\\"It's true. You ought to know that.\\\" She waited for a moment. \\\"You did\\nit,\\\" she added. \\\"Mamma said so.\\\"\\n\\nAt this onslaught Lulu was stupefied. For she began to perceive its\\ntruth.\\n\\n\\\"I know what I want to do, I guess,\\\" Di muttered, as if to try to cover\\nwhat she had said.\\n\\nUp to that moment, Lulu had been feeling intensely that she understood\\nDi, but that Di did not know this. Now Lulu felt that she and Di\\nactually shared some unsuspected sisterhood. It was not only that they\\nwere both badgered by Dwight. It was more than that. They were two\\nwomen. And she must make Di know that she understood her.\\n\\n\\\"Di,\\\" Lulu said, breathing hard, \\\"what you just said is true, I guess.\\nDon't you think I don't know. And now I'm going to tell you--\\\"\\n\\nShe might have poured it all out, claimed her kinship with Di by virtue\\nof that which had happened in Savannah, Georgia. But Di said:\\n\\n\\\"Here come some ladies. And goodness, look at the way you look!\\\"\\n\\nLulu glanced down. \\\"I know,\\\" she said, \\\"but I guess you'll have to put\\nup with me.\\\"\\n\\nThe two women entered, looked about with the complaisance of those who\\nexamine a hotel property, find criticism incumbent, and have no errand.\\nThese two women had outdressed their occasion. In their presence Di kept\\nsilence, turned away her head, gave them to know that she had nothing to\\ndo with this blue cotton person beside her. When they had gone on, \\\"What\\ndo you mean by my having to put up with you?\\\" Di asked sharply.\\n\\n\\\"I mean I'm going to stay with you.\\\"\\n\\nDi laughed scornfully--she was again the rebellious child. \\\"I guess\\nBobby'll have something to say about that,\\\" she said insolently.\\n\\n\\\"They left you in my charge.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I'm not a baby--the idea, Aunt Lulu!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm going to stay right with you,\\\" said Lulu. She wondered what she\\nshould do if Di suddenly marched away from her, through that bright\\nlobby and into the street. She thought miserably that she must follow.\\nAnd then her whole concern for the ethics of Di's course was lost in her\\nagonised memory of her terrible, broken shoes.\\n\\nDi did not march away. She turned her back squarely upon Lulu, and\\nlooked out of the window. For her life Lulu could think of nothing more\\nto say. She was now feeling miserably on the defensive.\\n\\nThey were sitting in silence when Bobby Larkin came into the room.\\n\\nFour Bobby Larkins there were, in immediate succession.\\n\\nThe Bobby who had just come down the street was distinctly perturbed,\\ncame hurrying, now and then turned to the left when he met folk, glanced\\nsidewise here and there, was altogether anxious and ill at ease.\\n\\nThe Bobby who came through the hotel was a Bobby who had on an\\nimportance assumed for the crisis of threading the lobby--a Bobby who\\nwished it to be understood that here he was, a man among men, in the\\nHess House at Millton.\\n\\nThe Bobby who entered the little rose room was the Bobby who was no less\\nthan overwhelmed with the stupendous character of the adventure upon\\nwhich he found himself.\\n\\nThe Bobby who incredibly came face to face with Lulu was the real Bobby\\ninto whose eyes leaped instant, unmistakable relief.\\n\\nDi flew to meet him. She assumed all the pretty agitations of her r\\u00f4le,\\nignored Lulu.\\n\\n\\\"Bobby! Is it all right?\\\"\\n\\nBobby looked over her head.\\n\\n\\\"Miss Lulu,\\\" he said fatuously. \\\"If it ain't Miss Lulu.\\\"\\n\\nHe looked from her to Di, and did not take in Di's resigned shrug.\\n\\n\\\"Bobby,\\\" said Di, \\\"she's come to stop us getting married, but she\\ncan't. I've told her so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She don't have to stop us,\\\" quoth Bobby gloomily, \\\"we're stopped.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you mean?\\\" Di laid one hand flatly along her cheek, instinctive\\nin her melodrama.\\n\\nBobby drew down his brows, set his hand on his leg, elbow out.\\n\\n\\\"We're minors,\\\" said he.\\n\\n\\\"Well, gracious, you didn't have to tell them that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. They knew _I_ was.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, Silly! Why didn't you tell them you're not?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I am.\\\"\\n\\nDi stared. \\\"For pity sakes,\\\" she said, \\\"don't you know how to do\\nanything?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What would you have me do?\\\" he inquired indignantly, with his head held\\nvery stiff, and with a boyish, admirable lift of chin.\\n\\n\\\"Why, tell them we're both twenty-one. We look it. We know we're\\nresponsible--that's all they care for. Well, you are a funny....\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You wanted me to lie?\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, don't make out you never told a fib.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, but this--\\\" he stared at her.\\n\\n\\\"I never heard of such a thing,\\\" Di cried accusingly.\\n\\n\\\"Anyhow,\\\" he said, \\\"there's nothing to do now. The cat's out. I've told\\nour ages. We've got to have our folks in on it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is that all you can think of?\\\" she demanded.\\n\\n\\\"What else?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, come on to Bainbridge or Holt, and tell them we're of age, and be\\nmarried there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Di,\\\" said Bobby, \\\"why, that'd be a rotten go.\\\"\\n\\nDi said, oh very well, if he didn't want to marry her. He replied\\nstonily that of course he wanted to marry her. Di stuck out her little\\nhand. She was at a disadvantage. She could use no arts, with Lulu\\nsitting there, looking on. \\\"Well, then, come on to Bainbridge,\\\" Di\\ncried, and rose.\\n\\nLulu was thinking: \\\"What shall I say? I don't know what to say. I don't\\nknow what I can say.\\\" Now she also rose, and laughed awkwardly. \\\"I've\\ntold Di,\\\" she said to Bobby, \\\"that wherever you two go, I'm going too.\\nDi's folks left her in my care, you know. So you'll have to take me\\nalong, I guess.\\\" She spoke in a manner of distinct apology.\\n\\nAt this Bobby had no idea what to reply. He looked down miserably at the\\ncarpet. His whole manner was a mute testimony to his participation in\\nthe eternal query: How did I get into it?\\n\\n\\\"Bobby,\\\" said Di, \\\"are you going to let her lead you home?\\\"\\n\\nThis of course nettled him, but not in the manner on which Di had\\ncounted. He said loudly:\\n\\n\\\"I'm not going to Bainbridge or Holt or any town and lie, to get you or\\nany other girl.\\\"\\n\\nDi's head lifted, tossed, turned from him. \\\"You're about as much like a\\nman in a story,\\\" she said, \\\"as--as papa is.\\\"\\n\\nThe two idly inspecting women again entered the rose room, this time to\\nstay. They inspected Lulu too. And Lulu rose and stood between the\\nlovers.\\n\\n\\\"Hadn't we all better get the four-thirty to Warbleton?\\\" she said, and\\nswallowed.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, if Bobby wants to back out--\\\" said Di.\\n\\n\\\"I don't want to back out,\\\" Bobby contended furiously, \\\"b-b-but I\\nwon't--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come on, Aunt Lulu,\\\" said Di grandly.\\n\\nBobby led the way through the lobby, Di followed, and Lulu brought up\\nthe rear. She walked awkwardly, eyes down, her hands stiffly held. Heads\\nturned to look at her. They passed into the street.\\n\\n\\\"You two go ahead,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"so they won't think--\\\"\\n\\nThey did so, and she followed, and did not know where to look, and\\nthought of her broken shoes.\\n\\nAt the station, Bobby put them on the train and stepped back. He had, he\\nsaid, something to see to there in Millton. Di did not look at him. And\\nLulu's good-bye spoke her genuine regret for all.\\n\\n\\\"Aunt Lulu,\\\" said Di, \\\"you needn't think I'm going to sit with you. You\\nlook as if you were crazy. I'll sit back here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All right, Di,\\\" said Lulu humbly.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nIt was nearly six o'clock when they arrived at the Deacons'. Mrs. Bett\\nstood on the porch, her hands rolled in her apron.\\n\\n\\\"Surprise for you!\\\" she called brightly.\\n\\nBefore they had reached the door, Ina bounded from the hall.\\n\\n\\\"Darling!\\\"\\n\\nShe seized upon Di, kissed her loudly, drew back from her, saw the\\ntravelling bag.\\n\\n\\\"My new bag!\\\" she cried. \\\"Di! What have you got that for?\\\"\\n\\nIn any embarrassment Di's instinctive defence was hearty laughter. She\\nnow laughed heartily, kissed her mother again, and ran up the stairs.\\n\\nLulu slipped by her sister, and into the kitchen.\\n\\n\\\"Well, where have _you_ been?\\\" cried Ina. \\\"I declare, I never saw such\\na family. Mamma don't know anything and neither of you will tell\\nanything.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mamma knows a-plenty,\\\" snapped Mrs. Bett.\\n\\nMonona, who was eating a sticky gift, jumped stiffly up and down.\\n\\n\\\"You'll catch it--you'll catch it!\\\" she sent out her shrill general\\nwarning.\\n\\nMrs. Bett followed Lulu to the kitchen; \\\"I didn't tell Inie about her\\nbag and now she says I don't know nothing,\\\" she complained. \\\"There I\\nknew about the bag the hull time, but I wasn't going to tell her and\\nspoil her gettin' home.\\\" She banged the stove-griddle. \\\"I've a good\\nnotion not to eat a mouthful o' supper,\\\" she announced.\\n\\n\\\"Mother, please!\\\" said Lulu passionately. \\\"Stay here. Help me. I've got\\nenough to get through to-night.\\\"\\n\\nDwight had come home. Lulu could hear Ina pouring out to him the\\nmysterious circumstance of the bag, could hear the exaggerated air of\\nthe casual with which he always received the excitement of another, and\\nespecially of his Ina. Then she heard Ina's feet padding up the stairs,\\nand after that Di's shrill, nervous laughter. Lulu felt a pang of pity\\nfor Di, as if she herself were about to face them.\\n\\nThere was not time both to prepare supper and to change the blue cotton\\ndress. In that dress Lulu was pouring water when Dwight entered the\\ndining-room.\\n\\n\\\"Ah!\\\" said he. \\\"Our festive ball-gown.\\\"\\n\\nShe gave him her hand, with her peculiar sweetness of expression--almost\\nas if she were sorry for him or were bidding him good-bye.\\n\\n\\\"_That_ shows who you dress for!\\\" he cried. \\\"You dress for me; Ina,\\naren't you jealous? Lulu dresses for me!\\\"\\n\\nIna had come in with Di, and both were excited, and Ina's head was\\nmoving stiffly, as in all her indignations. Mrs. Bett had thought better\\nof it and had given her presence. Already Monona was singing.\\n\\n\\\"Lulu,\\\" said Dwight, \\\"really? Can't you run up and slip on another\\ndress?\\\"\\n\\nLulu sat down in her place. \\\"No,\\\" she said. \\\"I'm too tired. I'm sorry,\\nDwight.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It seems to me--\\\" he began.\\n\\n\\\"I don't want any,\\\" said Monona.\\n\\nBut no one noticed Monona, and Ina did not defer even to Dwight. She,\\nwho measured delicate, troy occasions by avoirdupois, said brightly:\\n\\n\\\"Now, Di. You must tell us all about it. Where had you and Aunt Lulu\\nbeen with mamma's new bag?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Aunt Lulu!\\\" cried Dwight. \\\"A-ha! So Aunt Lulu was along. Well now, that\\nalters it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How does it?\\\" asked his Ina crossly.\\n\\n\\\"Why, when Aunt Lulu goes on a jaunt,\\\" said Dwight Herbert, \\\"events\\nbegin to event.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come, Di, let's hear,\\\" said Ina.\\n\\n\\\"Ina,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"first can't we hear something about your visit? How\\nis----\\\"\\n\\nHer eyes consulted Dwight. His features dropped, the lines of his face\\ndropped, its muscles seemed to sag. A look of suffering was in his eyes.\\n\\n\\\"She'll never be any better,\\\" he said. \\\"I know we've said good-bye to\\nher for the last time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Dwight!\\\" said Lulu.\\n\\n\\\"She knew it too,\\\" he said. \\\"It--it put me out of business, I can tell\\nyou. She gave me my start--she took all the care of me--taught me to\\nread--she's the only mother I ever knew----\\\" He stopped, and opened his\\neyes wide on account of their dimness.\\n\\n\\\"They said she was like another person while Dwight was there,\\\" said\\nIna, and entered upon a length of particulars, and details of the\\njourney. These details Dwight interrupted: Couldn't Lulu remember that\\nhe liked sage on the chops? He could hardly taste it. He had, he said,\\ntold her this thirty-seven times. And when she said that she was sorry,\\n\\\"Perhaps you think I'm sage enough,\\\" said the witty fellow.\\n\\n\\\"Dwightie!\\\" said Ina. \\\"Mercy.\\\" She shook her head at him. \\\"Now, Di,\\\" she\\nwent on, keeping the thread all this time. \\\"Tell us your story. About\\nthe bag.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, mamma,\\\" said Di, \\\"let me eat my supper.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And so you shall, darling. Tell it in your own way. Tell us first what\\nyou've done since we've been away. Did Mr. Cornish come to see you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Di, and flashed a look at Lulu.\\n\\nBut eventually they were back again before that new black bag. And Di\\nwould say nothing. She laughed, squirmed, grew irritable, laughed again.\\n\\n\\\"Lulu!\\\" Ina demanded. \\\"You were with her--where in the world had you\\nbeen? Why, but you couldn't have been with her--in that dress. And yet\\nI saw you come in the gate together.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What!\\\" cried Dwight Herbert, drawing down his brows. \\\"You certainly did\\nnot so far forget us, Lulu, as to go on the street in that dress?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's a good dress,\\\" Mrs. Bett now said positively. \\\"Of course it's a\\ngood dress. Lulie wore it on the street--of course she did. She was gone\\na long time. I made me a cup o' tea, and _then_ she hadn't come.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Ina, \\\"I never heard anything like this before. Where were\\nyou both?\\\"\\n\\nOne would say that Ina had entered into the family and been born again,\\nidentified with each one. Nothing escaped her. Dwight, too, his intimacy\\nwas incredible.\\n\\n\\\"Put an end to this, Lulu,\\\" he commanded. \\\"Where were you two--since you\\nmake such a mystery?\\\"\\n\\nDi's look at Lulu was piteous, terrified. Di's fear of her father was\\nnow clear to Lulu. And Lulu feared him too. Abruptly she heard herself\\ntemporising, for the moment making common cause with Di.\\n\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" she said, \\\"we have a little secret. Can't we have a secret if we\\nwant one?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Upon my word,\\\" Dwight commented, \\\"she has a beautiful secret. I don't\\nknow about your secrets, Lulu.\\\"\\n\\nEvery time that he did this, that fleet, lifted look of Lulu's seemed to\\nbleed.\\n\\n\\\"I'm glad for my dinner,\\\" remarked Monona at last. \\\"Please excuse me.\\\"\\nOn that they all rose. Lulu stayed in the kitchen and did her best to\\nmake her tasks indefinitely last. She had nearly finished when Di burst\\nin.\\n\\n\\\"Aunt Lulu, Aunt Lulu!\\\" she cried. \\\"Come in there--come. I can't stand\\nit. What am I going to do?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Di, dear,\\\" said Lulu. \\\"Tell your mother--you must tell her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She'll cry,\\\" Di sobbed. \\\"Then she'll tell papa--and he'll never stop\\ntalking about it. I know him--every day he'll keep it going. After he\\nscolds me it'll be a joke for months. I'll die--I'll die, Aunt Lulu.\\\"\\n\\nIna's voice sounded in the kitchen. \\\"What are you two whispering about?\\nI declare, mamma's hurt, Di, at the way you're acting....\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let's go out on the porch,\\\" said Lulu, and when Di would have escaped,\\nIna drew her with them, and handled the situation in the only way that\\nshe knew how to handle it, by complaining: Well, but what in this\\nworld....\\n\\nLulu threw a white shawl about her blue cotton dress.\\n\\n\\\"A bridal robe,\\\" said Dwight. \\\"How's that, Lulu--what are _you_ wearing\\na bridal robe for--eh?\\\"\\n\\nShe smiled dutifully. There was no need to make him angry, she\\nreflected, before she must. He had not yet gone into the parlour--had\\nnot yet asked for his mail.\\n\\nIt was a warm dusk, moonless, windless. The sounds of the village\\nstreet came in--laughter, a touch at a piano, a chiming clock. Lights\\nstarred and quickened in the blurred houses. Footsteps echoed on the\\nboard walks. The gate opened. The gloom yielded up Cornish.\\n\\nLulu was inordinately glad to see him. To have the strain of the time\\nbroken by him was like hearing, on a lonely whiter wakening, the clock\\nstrike reassuring dawn.\\n\\n\\\"Lulu,\\\" said Dwight low, \\\"your dress. Do go!\\\"\\n\\nLulu laughed. \\\"The bridal shawl takes off the curse,\\\" she said.\\n\\nCornish, in his gentle way, asked about the journey, about the sick\\nwoman--and Dwight talked of her again, and this time his voice broke. Di\\nwas curiously silent. When Cornish addressed her, she replied simply and\\ndirectly--the rarest of Di's manners, in fact not Di's manner at all.\\nLulu spoke not at all--it was enough to have this respite.\\n\\nAfter a little the gate opened again. It was Bobby. In the besetting\\nfear that he was leaving Di to face something alone, Bobby had arrived.\\n\\nAnd now Di's spirits rose. To her his presence meant repentance,\\nrecapitulation. Her laugh rang out, her replies came archly. But Bobby\\nwas plainly not playing up. Bobby was, in fact, hardly less than glum.\\nIt was Dwight, the irrepressible fellow, who kept the talk going. And it\\nwas no less than deft, his continuously displayed ability playfully to\\npierce Lulu. Some one had \\\"married at the drop of the hat. You know the\\nkind of girl?\\\" And some one \\\"made up a likely story to soothe her own\\npride--you know how they do that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Ina, \\\"my part, I think _the_ most awful thing is to have\\nsomebody one loves keep secrets from one. No wonder folks get crabbed\\nand spiteful with such treatment.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mamma!\\\" Monona shouted from her room. \\\"Come and hear me say my\\nprayers!\\\"\\n\\nMonona entered this request with precision on Ina's nastiest moments,\\nbut she always rose, unabashed, and went, motherly and dutiful, to hear\\ndevotions, as if that function and the process of living ran their two\\ndivided channels.\\n\\nShe had dispatched this errand and was returning when Mrs. Bett crossed\\nthe lawn from Grandma Gates's, where the old lady had taken comfort in\\nMrs. Bett's ministrations for an hour.\\n\\n\\\"Don't you help me,\\\" Mrs. Bett warned them away sharply. \\\"I guess I can\\nhelp myself yet awhile.\\\"\\n\\nShe gained her chair. And still in her momentary rule of attention, she\\nsaid clearly:\\n\\n\\\"I got a joke. Grandma Gates says it's all over town Di and Bobby Larkin\\neloped off together to-day. _He_!\\\" The last was a single note of\\nlaughter, high and brief.\\n\\nThe silence fell.\\n\\n\\\"What nonsense!\\\" Dwight Herbert said angrily.\\n\\nBut Ina said tensely: \\\"_Is_ it nonsense? Haven't I been trying and\\ntrying to find out where the black satchel went? Di!\\\"\\n\\nDi's laughter rose, but it sounded thin and false.\\n\\n\\\"Listen to that, Bobby,\\\" she said. \\\"Listen!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That won't do, Di,\\\" said Ina. \\\"You can't deceive mamma and don't you\\ntry!\\\" Her voice trembled, she was frantic with loving and authentic\\nanxiety, but she was without power, she overshadowed the real gravity of\\nthe moment by her indignation.\\n\\n\\\"Mrs. Deacon----\\\" began Bobby, and stood up, very straight and manly\\nbefore them all.\\n\\nBut Dwight intervened, Dwight, the father, the master of his house. Here\\nwas something requiring him to act. So the father set his face like a\\nmask and brought down his hand on the rail of the porch. It was as if\\nthe sound shattered a thousand filaments--where?\\n\\n\\\"Diana!\\\" his voice was terrible, demanded a response, ravened among\\nthem.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, papa,\\\" said Di, very small.\\n\\n\\\"Answer your mother. Answer _me_. Is there anything to this absurd\\ntale?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, papa,\\\" said Di, trembling.\\n\\n\\\"Nothing whatever?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nothing whatever.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Can you imagine how such a ridiculous report started?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, papa.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well. Now we know where we are. If anyone hears this report\\nrepeated, send them to _me_.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, but that satchel--\\\" said Ina, to whom an idea manifested less as\\na function than as a leech.\\n\\n\\\"One moment,\\\" said Dwight. \\\"Lulu will of course verify what the child\\nhas said.\\\"\\n\\nThere had never been an adult moment until that day when Lulu had not\\ninstinctively taken the part of the parents, of all parents. Now she saw\\nDwight's cruelty to her as his cruelty to Di; she saw Ina, herself a\\nchild in maternity, as ignorant of how to deal with the moment as was\\nDwight. She saw Di's falseness partly parented by these parents. She\\nburned at the enormity of Dwight's appeal to her for verification. She\\nthrew up her head and no one had ever seen Lulu look like this.\\n\\n\\\"If you cannot settle this with Di,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"you cannot settle it\\nwith me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A shifty answer,\\\" said Dwight. \\\"You have a genius at misrepresenting\\nfacts, you know, Lulu.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Bobby wanted to say something,\\\" said Ina, still troubled.\\n\\n\\\"No, Mrs. Deacon,\\\" said Bobby, low. \\\"I have nothing--more to say.\\\"\\n\\nIn a little while, when Bobby went away, Di walked with him to the gate.\\nIt was as if, the worst having happened to her, she dared everything\\nnow.\\n\\n\\\"Bobby,\\\" she said, \\\"you hate a lie. But what else could I do?\\\"\\n\\nHe could not see her, could see only the little moon of her face,\\nblurring.\\n\\n\\\"And anyhow,\\\" said Di, \\\"it wasn't a lie. We _didn't_ elope, did we?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you think I came for to-night?\\\" asked Bobby.\\n\\nThe day had aged him; he spoke like a man. His very voice came gruffly.\\nBut she saw nothing, softened to him, yielded, was ready to take his\\nregret that they had not gone on.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I came for one thing,\\\" said Bobby, \\\"to tell you that I couldn't\\nstand for your wanting me to lie to-day. Why, Di--I hate a lie. And now\\nto-night--\\\" He spoke his code almost beautifully. \\\"I'd rather,\\\" he said,\\n\\\"they had never let us see each other again than to lose you the way\\nI've lost you now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Bobby!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's true. We mustn't talk about it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Bobby! I'll go back and tell them all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You can't go back,\\\" said Bobby. \\\"Not out of a thing like that.\\\"\\n\\nShe stood staring after him. She heard some one coming and she turned\\ntoward the house, and met Cornish leaving.\\n\\n\\\"Miss Di,\\\" he cried, \\\"if you're going to elope with anybody, remember\\nit's with me!\\\"\\n\\nHer defence was ready--her laughter rang out so that the departing Bobby\\nmight hear.\\n\\nShe came back to the steps and mounted slowly in the lamplight, a little\\nwhite thing with whom birth had taken exquisite pains.\\n\\n\\\"If,\\\" she said, \\\"if you have any fear that I may ever elope with Bobby\\nLarkin, let it rest. I shall never marry him if he asks me fifty times a\\nday.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Really, darling?\\\" cried Ina.\\n\\n\\\"Really and truly,\\\" said Di, \\\"and he knows it, too.\\\"\\n\\nLulu listened and read all.\\n\\n\\\"I wondered,\\\" said Ina pensively, \\\"I wondered if you wouldn't see that\\nBobby isn't much beside that nice Mr. Cornish!\\\"\\n\\nWhen Di had gone upstairs, Ina said to Lulu in a manner of cajoling\\nconfidence:\\n\\n\\\"Sister----\\\" she rarely called her that, \\\"_why_ did you and Di have the\\nblack bag?\\\"\\n\\nSo that after all it was a relief to Lulu to hear Dwight ask casually:\\n\\\"By the way, Lulu, haven't I got some mail somewhere about?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There are two letters on the parlour table,\\\" Lulu answered. To Ina she\\nadded: \\\"Let's go in the parlour.\\\"\\n\\nAs they passed through the hall, Mrs. Bett was going up the stairs to\\nbed--when she mounted stairs she stooped her shoulders, bunched her\\nextremities, and bent her head. Lulu looked after her, as if she were\\nhalf minded to claim the protection so long lost.\\n\\nDwight lighted the gas. \\\"Better turn down the gas jest a little,\\\" said\\nhe, tirelessly.\\n\\nLulu handed him the two letters. He saw Ninian's writing and looked up,\\nsaid \\\"A-ha!\\\" and held it while he leisurely read the advertisement of\\ndental furniture, his Ina reading over his shoulder. \\\"A-ha!\\\" he said\\nagain, and with designed deliberation turned to Ninian's letter. \\\"An\\nepistle from my dear brother Ninian.\\\" The words failed, as he saw the\\nunsealed flap.\\n\\n\\\"You opened the letter?\\\" he inquired incredulously. Fortunately he had\\nno climaxes of furious calm for high occasions. All had been used on\\nsmall occasions. \\\"You opened the letter\\\" came in a tone of no deeper\\nhorror than \\\"You picked the flower\\\"--once put to Lulu.\\n\\nShe said nothing. As it is impossible to continue looking indignantly at\\nsome one who is not looking at you, Dwight turned to Ina, who was horror\\nand sympathy, a nice half and half.\\n\\n\\\"Your sister has been opening my mail,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"But, Dwight, if it's from Ninian--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is _my_ mail,\\\" he reminded her. \\\"She had asked me if she might open\\nit. Of course I told her no.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Ina practically, \\\"what does he say?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I shall open the letter in my own time. My present concern is this\\ndisregard of my wishes.\\\" His self-control was perfect, ridiculous,\\ndevilish. He was self-controlled because thus he could be more\\neffectively cruel than in temper. \\\"What excuse have you to offer?\\\"\\n\\nLulu was not looking at him. \\\"None,\\\" she said--not defiantly, or\\ningratiatingly, or fearfully. Merely, \\\"None.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why did you do it?\\\"\\n\\nShe smiled faintly and shook her head.\\n\\n\\\"Dwight,\\\" said Ina, reasonably, \\\"she knows what's in it and we don't.\\nHurry up.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She is,\\\" said Dwight, after a pause, \\\"an ungrateful woman.\\\"\\n\\nHe opened the letter, saw the clipping, the avowal, with its facts.\\n\\n\\\"A-ha!\\\" said he. \\\"So after having been absent with my brother for a\\nmonth, you find that you were _not_ married to him.\\\"\\n\\nLulu spoke her exceeding triumph.\\n\\n\\\"You see, Dwight,\\\" she said, \\\"he told the truth. He had another wife. He\\ndidn't just leave me.\\\"\\n\\nDwight instantly cried: \\\"But this seems to me to make you considerably\\nworse off than if he had.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no,\\\" Lulu said serenely. \\\"No. Why,\\\" she said, \\\"you know how it all\\ncame about. He--he was used to thinking of his wife as dead. If he\\nhadn't--hadn't liked me, he wouldn't have told me. You see that, don't\\nyou?\\\"\\n\\nDwight laughed. \\\"That your apology?\\\" he asked.\\n\\nShe said nothing.\\n\\n\\\"Look here, Lulu,\\\" he went on, \\\"this is a bad business. The less you say\\nabout it the better, for all our sakes--_you_ see that, don't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"See that? Why, no. I wanted you to write to him so I could tell the\\ntruth. You said I mustn't tell the truth till I had the proofs ...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tell who?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tell everybody. I want them to know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then you care nothing for our feelings in this matter?\\\"\\n\\nShe looked at him now. \\\"Your feeling?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's nothing to you that we have a brother who's a bigamist?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But it's me--it's me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You! You're completely out of it. Just let it rest as it is and it'll\\ndrop.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I want the people to know the truth,\\\" Lulu said.\\n\\n\\\"But it's nobody's business but our business! I take it you don't intend\\nto sue Ninian?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sue him? Oh no!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then, for all our sakes, let's drop the matter.\\\"\\n\\nLulu had fallen in one of her old attitudes, tense, awkward, her hands\\nawkwardly placed, her feet twisted. She kept putting a lock back of her\\near, she kept swallowing.\\n\\n\\\"Tell you, Lulu,\\\" said Dwight. \\\"Here are three of us. Our interests are\\nthe same in this thing--only Ninian is our relative and he's nothing to\\nyou now. Is he?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, no,\\\" said Lulu in surprise.\\n\\n\\\"Very well. Let's have a vote. Your snap judgment is to tell this\\ndisgraceful fact broadcast. Mine is, least said, soonest mended. What do\\nyou say, Ina--considering Di and all?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, goodness,\\\" said Ina, \\\"if we get mixed up with bigamy, we'll never\\nget away from it. Why, I wouldn't have it told for worlds.\\\"\\n\\nStill in that twisted position, Lulu looked up at her. Her straying\\nhair, her parted lips, her lifted eyes were singularly pathetic.\\n\\n\\\"My poor, poor sister!\\\" Ina said. She struck together her little plump\\nhands. \\\"Oh, Dwight--when I think of it: What have I done--what have _we_\\ndone that I should have a good, kind, loving husband--be so protected,\\nso loved, when other women.... Darling!\\\" she sobbed, and drew near to\\nLulu. \\\"You _know_ how sorry I am--we all are....\\\"\\n\\nLulu stood up. The white shawl slipped to the floor. Her hands were\\nstiffly joined.\\n\\n\\\"Then,\\\" she said, \\\"give me the only thing I've got--that's my pride. My\\npride--that he didn't want to get rid of me.\\\"\\n\\nThey stared at her. \\\"What about _my_ pride?\\\" Dwight called to her, as\\nacross great distances. \\\"Do you think I want everybody to know my\\nbrother did a thing like that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You can't help that,\\\" said Lulu.\\n\\n\\\"But I want you to help it. I want you to promise me that you won't\\nshame us like this before all our friends.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You want me to promise what?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I want you--I ask you,\\\" Dwight said with an effort, \\\"to promise me that\\nyou will keep this, with us--a family secret.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No!\\\" Lulu cried. \\\"No. I won't do it! I won't do it! I won't do it!\\\"\\n\\nIt was like some crude chant, knowing only two tones. She threw out her\\nhands, her wrists long and dark on her blue skirt. \\\"Can't you\\nunderstand anything?\\\" she asked. \\\"I've lived here all my life--on your\\nmoney. I've not been strong enough to work, they say--well, but I've\\nbeen strong enough to be a hired girl in your house--and I've been glad\\nto pay for my keep.... But there wasn't anything about it I liked.\\nNothing about being here that I liked.... Well, then I got a little\\nsomething, same as other folks. I thought I was married and I went off\\non the train and he bought me things and I saw the different towns. And\\nthen it was all a mistake. I didn't have any of it. I came back here and\\nwent into your kitchen again--I don't know why I came back. I s'pose\\nbecause I'm most thirty-four and new things ain't so easy any more--but\\nwhat have I got or what'll I ever have? And now you want to put on to me\\nhaving folks look at me and think he run off and left me, and having 'em\\nall wonder.... I can't stand it. I can't stand it. I can't....\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You'd rather they'd know he fooled you, when he had another wife?\\\"\\nDwight sneered.\\n\\n\\\"Yes! Because he wanted me. How do I know--maybe he wanted me only just\\nbecause he was lonesome, the way I was. I don't care why! And I won't\\nhave folks think he went and left me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That,\\\" said Dwight, \\\"is a wicked vanity.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's the truth. Well, why can't they know the truth?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And bring disgrace on us all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's me--it's me----\\\" Lulu's individualism strove against that terrible\\ntribal sense, was shattered by it.\\n\\n\\\"It's all of us!\\\" Dwight boomed. \\\"It's Di.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"_Di?_\\\" He had Lulu's eyes now.\\n\\n\\\"Why, it's chiefly on Di's account that I'm talking,\\\" said Dwight.\\n\\n\\\"How would it hurt Di?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To have a thing like that in the family? Well, can't you see how it'd\\nhurt her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Would it, Ina? Would it hurt Di?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, it would shame her--embarrass her--make people wonder what kind of\\nstock she came from--oh,\\\" Ina sobbed, \\\"my pure little girl!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hurt her prospects, of course,\\\" said Dwight. \\\"Anybody could see that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I s'pose it would,\\\" said Lulu.\\n\\nShe clasped her arms tightly, awkwardly, and stepped about the floor,\\nher broken shoes showing beneath her cotton skirt.\\n\\n\\\"When a family once gets talked about for any reason----\\\" said Ina and\\nshuddered.\\n\\n\\\"I'm talked about now!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But nothing that you could help. If he got tired of you, you couldn't\\nhelp that.\\\" This misstep was Dwight's.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" Lulu said, \\\"I couldn't help that. And I couldn't help his other\\nwife, either.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Bigamy,\\\" said Dwight, \\\"that's a crime.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've done no crime,\\\" said Lulu.\\n\\n\\\"Bigamy,\\\" said Dwight, \\\"disgraces everybody it touches.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Even Di,\\\" Lulu said.\\n\\n\\\"Lulu,\\\" said Dwight, \\\"on Di's account will you promise us to let this\\nthing rest with us three?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I s'pose so,\\\" said Lulu quietly.\\n\\n\\\"You will?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I s'pose so.\\\"\\n\\nIna sobbed: \\\"Thank you, thank you, Lulu. This makes up for everything.\\\"\\n\\nLulu was thinking: \\\"Di has a hard enough time as it is.\\\" Aloud she said:\\n\\\"I told Mr. Cornish, but he won't tell.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll see to that,\\\" Dwight graciously offered.\\n\\n\\\"Goodness,\\\" Ina said, \\\"so he knows. Well, that settles----\\\" She said no\\nmore.\\n\\n\\\"You'll be happy to think you've done this for us, Lulu,\\\" said Dwight.\\n\\n\\\"I s'pose so,\\\" said Lulu.\\n\\nIna, pink from her little gust of sobbing, went to her, kissed her, her\\ntrim tan tailor suit against Lulu's blue cotton.\\n\\n\\\"My sweet, self-sacrificing sister,\\\" she murmured.\\n\\n\\\"Oh stop that!\\\" Lulu said.\\n\\nDwight took her hand, lying limply in his. \\\"I can now,\\\" he said,\\n\\\"overlook the matter of the letter.\\\"\\n\\nLulu drew back. She put her hair behind her ears, swallowed, and cried\\nout.\\n\\n\\\"Don't you go around pitying me! I'll have you know I'm glad the whole\\nthing happened!\\\"\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nCornish had ordered six new copies of a popular song. He knew that it\\nwas popular because it was called so in a Chicago paper. When the six\\ncopies arrived with a danseuse on the covers he read the \\\"words,\\\" looked\\nwistfully at the symbols which shut him out, and felt well pleased.\\n\\n\\\"Got up quite attractive,\\\" he thought, and fastened the six copies in\\nthe window of his music store.\\n\\nIt was not yet nine o'clock of a vivid morning. Cornish had his floor\\nand sidewalk sprinkled, his red and blue plush piano spreads dusted.\\nHe sat at a folding table well back in the store, and opened a law book.\\n\\nFor half an hour he read. Then he found himself looking off the page,\\nstabbed by a reflection which always stabbed him anew: Was he really\\ngetting anywhere with his law? And where did he really hope to get? Of\\nlate when he awoke at night this question had stood by the cot, waiting.\\n\\nThe cot had appeared there in the back of the music-store, behind a dark\\nsateen curtain with too few rings on the wire. How little else was in\\nthere, nobody knew. But those passing in the late evening saw the blur\\nof his kerosene lamp behind that curtain and were smitten by a realistic\\nillusion of personal loneliness.\\n\\nIt was behind that curtain that these unreasoning questions usually\\nattacked him, when his giant, wavering shadow had died upon the wall and\\nthe faint smell of the extinguished lamp went with him to his bed; or\\nwhen he waked before any sign of dawn. In the mornings all was cheerful\\nand wonted--the question had not before attacked him among his red and\\nblue plush spreads, his golden oak and ebony cases, of a sunshiny\\nmorning.\\n\\nA step at his door set him flying. He wanted passionately to sell a\\npiano.\\n\\n\\\"Well!\\\" he cried, when he saw his visitor.\\n\\nIt was Lulu, in her dark red suit and her tilted hat.\\n\\n\\\"Well!\\\" she also said, and seemed to have no idea of saying anything\\nelse. Her excitement was so obscure that he did not discern it.\\n\\n\\\"You're out early,\\\" said he, participating in the village chorus of this\\nbright challenge at this hour.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no,\\\" said Lulu.\\n\\nHe looked out the window, pretending to be caught by something passing,\\nleaned to see it the better.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, how'd you get along last night?\\\" he asked, and wondered why he had\\nnot thought to say it before.\\n\\n\\\"All right, thank you,\\\" said Lulu.\\n\\n\\\"Was he--about the letter, you know?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" she said, \\\"but that didn't matter. You'll be sure,\\\" she added,\\n\\\"not to say anything about what was in the letter?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, not till you tell me I can,\\\" said Cornish, \\\"but won't everybody\\nknow now?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" Lulu said.\\n\\nAt this he had no more to say, and feeling his speculation in his eyes,\\ndropped them to a piano scarf from which he began flicking invisible\\nspecks.\\n\\n\\\"I came to tell you good-bye,\\\" Lulu said.\\n\\n\\\"_Good-bye!_\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. I'm going off--for a while. My satchel's in the bakery--I had my\\nbreakfast in the bakery.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Say!\\\" Cornish cried warmly, \\\"then everything _wasn't_ all right last\\nnight?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As right as it can ever be with me,\\\" she told him. \\\"Oh, yes. Dwight\\nforgave me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Forgave you!\\\"\\n\\nShe smiled, and trembled.\\n\\n\\\"Look here,\\\" said Cornish, \\\"you come here and sit down and tell me about\\nthis.\\\"\\n\\nHe led her to the folding table, as the only social spot in that vast\\narea of his, seated her in the one chair, and for himself brought up a\\npiano stool. But after all she told him nothing. She merely took the\\ncomfort of his kindly indignation.\\n\\n\\\"It came out all right,\\\" she said only. \\\"But I won't stay there any\\nmore. I can't do that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then what are you going to do?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In Millton yesterday,\\\" she said, \\\"I saw an advertisement in the\\nhotel--they wanted a chambermaid.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Miss Bett!\\\" he cried. At that name she flushed. \\\"Why,\\\" said\\nCornish, \\\"you must have been coming from Millton yesterday when I saw\\nyou. I noticed Miss Di had her bag--\\\" He stopped, stared.\\n\\n\\\"You brought her back!\\\" he deduced everything.\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" said Lulu. \\\"Oh, no--I mean--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I heard about the eloping again this morning,\\\" he said. \\\"That's just\\nwhat you did--you brought her back.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You mustn't tell that! You won't? You won't!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. 'Course not.\\\" He mulled it. \\\"You tell me this: Do they know? I mean\\nabout your going after her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You never told!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They don't know she went.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's a funny thing,\\\" he blurted out, \\\"for you not to tell her\\nfolks--I mean, right off. Before last night....\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You don't know them. Dwight'd never let up on that--he'd _joke_ her\\nabout it after a while.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But it seems--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ina'd talk about disgracing _her_. They wouldn't know what to do.\\nThere's no sense in telling them. They aren't a mother and father,\\\" Lulu\\nsaid.\\n\\nCornish was not accustomed to deal with so much reality. But Lulu's\\nreality he could grasp.\\n\\n\\\"You're a trump anyhow,\\\" he affirmed.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no,\\\" said Lulu modestly.\\n\\nYes, she was. He insisted upon it.\\n\\n\\\"By George,\\\" he exclaimed, \\\"you don't find very many _married_ women\\nwith as good sense as you've got.\\\"\\n\\nAt this, just as he was agonising because he had seemed to refer to the\\ntruth that she was, after all, not married, at this Lulu laughed in some\\namusement, and said nothing.\\n\\n\\\"You've been a jewel in their home all right,\\\" said Cornish. \\\"I bet\\nthey'll miss you if you do go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They'll miss my cooking,\\\" Lulu said without bitterness.\\n\\n\\\"They'll miss more than that, I know. I've often watched you there--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have?\\\" It was not so much pleasure as passionate gratitude which\\nlighted her eyes.\\n\\n\\\"You made the whole place,\\\" said Cornish.\\n\\n\\\"You don't mean just the cooking?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no. I mean--well, that first night when you played croquet. I felt\\nat home when you came out.\\\"\\n\\nThat look of hers, rarely seen, which was no less than a look of\\nloveliness, came now to Lulu's face. After a pause she said: \\\"I never\\nhad but one compliment before that wasn't for my cooking.\\\" She seemed to\\nfeel that she must confess to that one. \\\"He told me I done my hair up\\nnice.\\\" She added conscientiously: \\\"That was after I took notice how the\\nladies in Savannah, Georgia, done up theirs.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, well,\\\" said Cornish only.\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"I must be going now. I wanted to say good-bye to\\nyou--and there's one or two other places....\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hate to have you go,\\\" said Cornish, and tried to add something. \\\"I\\nhate to have you go,\\\" was all that he could find to add.\\n\\nLulu rose. \\\"Oh, well,\\\" was all that she could find.\\n\\nThey shook hands, Lulu laughing a little. Cornish followed her to the\\ndoor. He had begun on \\\"Look here, I wish ...\\\" when Lulu said\\n\\\"good-bye,\\\" and paused, wishing intensely to know what he would have\\nsaid. But all that he said was: \\\"Good-bye. I wish you weren't going.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So do I,\\\" said Lulu, and went, still laughing.\\n\\nCornish saw her red dress vanish from his door, flash by his window, her\\nhead averted. And there settled upon him a depression out of all\\nproportion to the slow depression of his days. This was more--it\\nassailed him, absorbed him.\\n\\nHe stood staring out the window. Some one passed with a greeting of\\nwhich he was conscious too late to return. He wandered back down the\\nstore and his pianos looked back at him like strangers. Down there was\\nthe green curtain which screened his home life. He suddenly hated that\\ngreen curtain. He hated this whole place. For the first time it\\noccurred to him that he hated Warbleton.\\n\\nHe came back to his table, and sat down before his lawbook. But he sat,\\nchin on chest, regarding it. No ... no escape that way....\\n\\nA step at the door and he sprang up. It was Lulu, coming toward him, her\\nface unsmiling but somehow quite lighted. In her hand was a letter.\\n\\n\\\"See,\\\" she said. \\\"At the office was this....\\\"\\n\\nShe thrust in his hand the single sheet. He read:\\n\\n\\\" ... Just wanted you to know you're actually rid of me. I've heard from\\nher, in Brazil. She ran out of money and thought of me, and her lawyer\\nwrote to me.... I've never been any good--Dwight would tell you that if\\nhis pride would let him tell the truth once in a while. But there ain't\\nanything in my life makes me feel as bad as this.... I s'pose you\\ncouldn't understand and I don't myself.... Only the sixteen years\\nkeeping still made me think she was gone sure ... but you were so\\ndownright good, that's what was the worst ... do you see what I want to\\nsay ...\\\"\\n\\n\\nCornish read it all and looked at Lulu. She was grave and in her eyes\\nthere was a look of dignity such as he had never seen them wear.\\nIncredible dignity.\\n\\n\\\"He didn't lie to get rid of me--and she was alive, just as he thought\\nshe might be,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"I'm glad,\\\" said Cornish.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Lulu. \\\"He isn't quite so bad as Dwight tried to make him\\nout.\\\"\\n\\nIt was not of this that Cornish had been thinking.\\n\\n\\\"Now you're free,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, that ...\\\" said Lulu.\\n\\nShe replaced her letter in its envelope.\\n\\n\\\"Now I'm really going,\\\" she said. \\\"Good-bye for sure this time....\\\"\\n\\nHer words trailed away. Cornish had laid his hand on her arm.\\n\\n\\\"Don't say good-bye,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"It's late,\\\" she said, \\\"I--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't you go,\\\" said Cornish.\\n\\nShe looked at him mutely.\\n\\n\\\"Do you think you could possibly stay here with me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" said Lulu, like no word.\\n\\nHe went on, not looking at her. \\\"I haven't got anything. I guess maybe\\nyou've heard something about a little something I'm supposed to inherit.\\nWell, it's only five hundred dollars.\\\"\\n\\nHis look searched her face, but she hardly heard what he was saying.\\n\\n\\\"That little Warden house--it don't cost much--you'd be surprised. Rent,\\nI mean. I can get it now. I went and looked at it the other day, but\\nthen I didn't think--\\\" he caught himself on that. \\\"It don't cost near\\nas much as this store. We could furnish up the parlour with pianos--\\\"\\n\\nHe was startled by that \\\"we,\\\" and began again:\\n\\n\\\"That is, if you could ever think of such a thing as marrying me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But,\\\" said Lulu. \\\"You _know_! Why, don't the disgrace--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What disgrace?\\\" asked Cornish.\\n\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" she said, \\\"you--you----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There's only this about that,\\\" said he. \\\"Of course, if you loved him\\nvery much, then I'd ought not to be talking this way to you. But I\\ndidn't think--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You didn't think what?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That you did care so very much--about him. I don't know why.\\\"\\n\\nShe said: \\\"I wanted somebody of my own. That's the reason I done what I\\ndone. I know that now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I figured that way,\\\" said Cornish.\\n\\nThey dismissed it. But now he brought to bear something which he saw\\nthat she should know.\\n\\n\\\"Look here,\\\" he said, \\\"I'd ought to tell you. I'm--I'm awful lonesome\\nmyself. This is no place to live. And I guess living so is one reason\\nwhy I want to get married. I want some kind of a home.\\\"\\n\\nHe said it as a confession. She accepted it as a reason.\\n\\n\\\"Of course,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"I ain't never lived what you might say private,\\\" said Cornish.\\n\\n\\\"I've lived too private,\\\" Lulu said.\\n\\n\\\"Then there's another thing.\\\" This was harder to tell her. \\\"I--I don't\\nbelieve I'm ever going to be able to do a thing with law.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't see,\\\" said Lulu, \\\"how anybody does.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm not much good in a business way,\\\" he owned, with a faint laugh.\\n\\\"Sometimes I think,\\\" he drew down his brows, \\\"that I may never be able\\nto make any money.\\\"\\n\\nShe said: \\\"Lots of men don't.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Could you risk it with me?\\\" Cornish asked her. \\\"There's nobody I've\\nseen,\\\" he went on gently, \\\"that I like as much as I do you. I--I was\\nengaged to a girl once, but we didn't get along. I guess if you'd be\\nwilling to try me, we would get along.\\\"\\n\\nLulu said: \\\"I thought it was Di that you--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Miss Di? Why,\\\" said Cornish, \\\"she's a little kid. And,\\\" he added,\\n\\\"she's a little liar.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I'm going on thirty-four.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So am I!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Isn't there somebody--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Look here. Do you like me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well enough--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's you I was thinking of,\\\" said Lulu. \\\"I'd be all right.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then!\\\" Cornish cried, and he kissed her.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\n\\\"And now,\\\" said Dwight, \\\"nobody must mind if I hurry a little wee bit.\\nI've got something on.\\\"\\n\\nHe and Ina and Monona were at dinner. Mrs. Bett was in her room. Di was\\nnot there.\\n\\n\\\"Anything about Lulu?\\\" Ina asked.\\n\\n\\\"Lulu?\\\" Dwight stared. \\\"Why should I have anything to do about Lulu?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, but, Dwight--we've got to do something.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As I told you this morning,\\\" he observed, \\\"we shall do nothing. Your\\nsister is of age--I don't know about the sound mind, but she is\\ncertainly of age. If she chooses to go away, she is free to go where she\\nwill.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, but, Dwight, where has she gone? Where could she go? Where--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are a question-box,\\\" said Dwight playfully. \\\"A question-box.\\\"\\n\\nIna had burned her plump wrist on the oven. She lifted her arm and\\nnursed it.\\n\\n\\\"I'm certainly going to miss her if she stays away very long,\\\" she\\nremarked.\\n\\n\\\"You should be sufficient unto your little self,\\\" said Dwight.\\n\\n\\\"That's all right,\\\" said Ina, \\\"except when you're getting dinner.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I want some crust coffee,\\\" announced Monona firmly.\\n\\n\\\"You'll have nothing of the sort,\\\" said Ina. \\\"Drink your milk.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As I remarked,\\\" Dwight went on, \\\"I'm in a tiny wee bit of a hurry.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, why don't you say what for?\\\" his Ina asked.\\n\\nShe knew that he wanted to be asked, and she was sufficiently willing to\\nplay his games, and besides she wanted to know. But she _was_ hot.\\n\\n\\\"I am going,\\\" said Dwight, \\\"to take Grandma Gates out in a wheel-chair,\\nfor an hour.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where did you get a wheel-chair, for mercy sakes?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Borrowed it from the railroad company,\\\" said Dwight, with the triumph\\npeculiar to the resourceful man. \\\"Why I never did it before, I can't\\nimagine. There that chair's been in the depot ever since I can\\nremember--saw it every time I took the train--and yet I never once\\nthought of grandma.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My, Dwight,\\\" said Ina, \\\"how good you are!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nonsense!\\\" said he.\\n\\n\\\"Well, you are. Why don't I send her over a baked apple? Monona, you\\ntake Grandma Gates a baked apple--no. You shan't go till you drink your\\nmilk.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't want it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Drink it or mamma won't let you go.\\\"\\n\\nMonona drank it, made a piteous face, took the baked apple, ran.\\n\\n\\\"The apple isn't very good,\\\" said Ina, \\\"but it shows my good will.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Also,\\\" said Dwight, \\\"it teaches Monona a life of thoughtfulness for\\nothers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's what I always think,\\\" his Ina said.\\n\\n\\\"Can't you get mother to come out?\\\" Dwight inquired.\\n\\n\\\"I had so much to do getting dinner onto the table, I didn't try,\\\" Ina\\nconfessed.\\n\\n\\\"You didn't have to try,\\\" Mrs. Bett's voice sounded. \\\"I was coming when\\nI got rested up.\\\"\\n\\nShe entered, looking vaguely about. \\\"I want Lulie,\\\" she said, and the\\ncorners of her mouth drew down. She ate her dinner cold, appeased in\\nvague areas by such martyrdom. They were still at table when the front\\ndoor opened.\\n\\n\\\"Monona hadn't ought to use the front door so common,\\\" Mrs. Bett\\ncomplained.\\n\\nBut it was not Monona. It was Lulu and Cornish.\\n\\n\\\"Well!\\\" said Dwight, tone curving downward.\\n\\n\\\"Well!\\\" said Ina, in replica.\\n\\n\\\"Lulie!\\\" said Mrs. Bett, and left her dinner, and went to her daughter\\nand put her hands upon her.\\n\\n\\\"We wanted to tell you first,\\\" Cornish said. \\\"We've just got married.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For _ever_ more!\\\" said Ina.\\n\\n\\\"What's this?\\\" Dwight sprang to his feet. \\\"You're joking!\\\" he cried with\\nhope.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" Cornish said soberly. \\\"We're married--just now. Methodist\\nparsonage. We've had our dinner,\\\" he added hastily.\\n\\n\\\"Where'd you have it?\\\" Ina demanded, for no known reason.\\n\\n\\\"The bakery,\\\" Cornish replied, and flushed.\\n\\n\\\"In the dining-room part,\\\" Lulu added.\\n\\nDwight's sole emotion was his indignation.\\n\\n\\\"What on earth did you do it for?\\\" he put it to them. \\\"Married in a\\nbakery--\\\"\\n\\nNo, no. They explained it again. Neither of them, they said, wanted the\\nfuss of a wedding.\\n\\nDwight recovered himself in a measure. \\\"I'm not surprised, after all,\\\"\\nhe said. \\\"Lulu usually marries in this way.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Bett patted her daughter's arm. \\\"Lulie,\\\" she said, \\\"why, Lulie. You\\nain't been and got married twice, have you? After waitin' so long?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't be disturbed, Mother Bett,\\\" Dwight cried. \\\"She wasn't married\\nthat first time, if you remember. No marriage about it!\\\"\\n\\nIna's little shriek sounded.\\n\\n\\\"Dwight!\\\" she cried. \\\"Now everybody'll have to know that. You'll have to\\ntell about Ninian now--and his other wife!\\\"\\n\\nStanding between her mother and Cornish, an arm of each about her, Lulu\\nlooked across at Ina and Dwight, and they all saw in her face a\\nhorrified realisation.\\n\\n\\\"Ina!\\\" she said. \\\"Dwight! You _will_ have to tell now, won't you? Why I\\nnever thought of that.\\\"\\n\\nAt this Dwight sneered, was sneering still as he went to give Grandma\\nGates her ride in the wheel-chair and as he stooped with patient\\nkindness to tuck her in.\\n\\nThe street door was closed. If Mrs. Bett was peeping through the blind,\\nno one saw her. In the pleasant mid-day light under the maples, Mr. and\\nMrs. Neil Cornish were hurrying toward the railway station.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MISS LULU BETT ***\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\\u2014the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\\u2122\\u2019s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\\u2122 collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\\u2122 and future\\ngenerations.

The Foundation\\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\u2019s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation\\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg\\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\\u2122 electronic works\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg\\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone.

JOE CARBROOK DOES SUCH WORK AS THIS IN CHINA\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE GENESIS OF THE EXPERIMENT\\n\\n\\nAfter years of waiting for time and place and person,\\nthe Rev. Walter Drury, an average Methodist\\npreacher, was ready to begin his Experiment.\\n\\nThe process of getting adjusted to its conditions was ended. He believed\\nthat, if he had health and nothing happened to his mind, he might count\\non at least eight years more at First Church, Delafield--a ten-year\\npastorate is nothing wonderful in to-day's Methodism. The right preacher\\nmakes his own time limit.\\n\\nHe would not think himself too good for Delafield, but neither did he\\nrate himself too low. He just felt that he was reasonably secure against\\npromotion, and that he need not be afraid of \\\"demotion.\\\" There are such\\nmen. They are a boon to bishops.\\n\\nThe unforeseen was to be reckoned with, of course, the possible\\nshattering of all his plans by some unimagined misfortune. But the man\\nwho waits until he is secure against the unknown never discovers\\nanything, not even himself.\\n\\nWalter Drury had at last found his man, or, rather, his boy, here in\\nDelafield. It was necessary to the Experiment that its subject should be\\na decent young fellow, not particularly keen on formal religion, but\\nwell set-up in body and mind; clean, straight, and able to use the\\nbrains he had when need arose.\\n\\nJohn Wesley, Jr., was such a boy.\\n\\nWould the result be worth what he was putting into the venture? That\\nwould depend on one's standards. The church doesn't doubt that the more\\nthan twice ten years' experiment of Helms in the south end of Boston has\\nbeen worth the price. And Helms has for company a few pioneers in other\\nfields who will tell you they have drawn good pay, in the outcomes of\\ntheir patience.\\n\\nStill, Walter Drury was a new sort of specialist. The thing he had in\\nmind to do had been almost tried a thousand times; a thousand times it\\nhad been begun. But so far as he knew no one preacher had thought to\\nfocus every possible influence on a single life through a full cycle of\\nchange. He meant his work to be intensive: not in degree only, but in\\nduration.\\n\\nAt the end of ten years! If, then, he had not shown, in results beyond\\nquestion, the direction of the church's next great advance, at least he\\nwould have had the measureless joy of the effort. No seeming failure\\ncould rob him of his reward.\\n\\nNow, do not image this preacher as a dreaming scattergood; he would do\\nas much as any man should, that is to say, his utmost, in his pulpit and\\nhis parish. The Experiment should be no robbing of collective Peter to\\npay individual Paul.\\n\\nBut every man has his avocation, his recreation, you know--golf, roses,\\ncoins, first editions, travel. Walter Drury, being a confirmed bachelor,\\nmissed both the joys and the demands of home life. No recluse, but,\\nrather, a companionable man, he cared little for what most people call\\namusement, but he cared tremendously for the human scene in which he\\nlived and worked. He would be happy in the Experiment for its sheer\\nhuman fascinations. That it held a deeper interest, that if it succeeded\\nit would reveal an untapped reservoir of resources available for the\\nchurch and the kingdom of God, did but make him the more eager to be at\\nit in hard earnest.\\n\\nThe church to whose work he had joyfully given himself from his youth\\nhad grown to be a mighty and a highly complex machine. Some thought it\\nwas more machinery than life, more organization than organism. But\\nWalter Drury knew better. It _was_ a wonderful machine, wheels within\\nwheels, but there was within the wheels the living spirit of the\\nprophet's vision.\\n\\nPartly because the church was so vast and its work of such infinite\\nvariety, very few of its members knew what it did, or how, or why. It\\nwas all over the land, and in the ends of the earth, for people joined\\nit; and they lived their lives in the cheerful and congenial circle of\\nits fellowship. But the planetary sweep of its program and its\\nenterprises was to most of them not even as a tale that is told. They\\nwere content to be busy with their own affairs, and had small curiosity\\nto know what meanings and mysteries might be discovered out in places\\nthey had never explored, even though just 'round the corner from the\\nweek-by-week activities of the familiar home congregation.\\n\\nWalter Drury, at the end of one reasonably successful pastorate, had\\nstood bewildered and baffled as he looked back over his five years of\\neffort against this persistent and amiable passivity. It was not a\\ndeliberate sin, or he might have denounced it; nor a temporary numbness,\\nor he might have waited for it to disappear. All the more it dismayed\\nhim.\\n\\nAt the beginning of his ministry he had set this goal before him, that\\nevery soul under his care might see as he saw, and see with him more\\nclearly year by year, the church's great work; its true and total\\nbusiness. He had not failed, as the Annual Conference reckons failure.\\nBut he knew he had been less than successful. The people of his\\nsuccessive appointments were receptive people as church folk go. Then\\nwho was to blame, that sermons and books and Advocates and pictures and\\nhigh officials and frequent great assemblies, always accomplishing\\nsomething, always left behind them the untouched, unmoved majority of\\nthe people called Methodists?\\n\\nIt was all this and more of the same sort, which at last took shape in\\nDrury's thought and fixed the manner and matter of the Experiment. This\\nboy he had found, with a name that might be either prophecy or mockery,\\nhe would study like a book. He would brood over his life. Mind you, he\\nwould take no advantage, use no influence unfairly. He would neither\\ndictate nor drive. He would not trespass even so far as to the outer\\nedges of the boy's free personality. For the most part he would stay in\\nthe background. But he would watch the boy, as for lesser outcomes\\nDarwin watched the creatures of wood and field. Without revealing all\\nhis purpose he would set before this boy good and evil; the lesser good\\nand the greater. He would use for high and holy ends the method which\\nthe tempter never tires of using for confusion. He would show this boy\\nthe kingdoms of the children of God, and the glories of them, and would\\npromise them to him, not for a moment's shame but for a life's devotion.\\n\\nAs to the particular form in which the result of the Experiment might\\nappear he cared little. He had a certain curiosity on the subject\\nnaturally, but he knew well enough that the Experiment would be useless\\nif he laid interfering hands on its inner processes. That would be like\\ntrimming a whitethorn tree in a formal garden, to make it resemble a\\npyramid. He was not making a thorn pyramid in an Italian garden; he\\nwanted an oak, to grow by the common road of all men's life. And oaks\\nmust grow oak-fashion, or not at all.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nFour years of the ten had passed. That part of the history of John\\nWesley, Jr., which is told in the following pages, is the story of the\\nother six years.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\n\\nAN INSTITUTE PANORAMA\\n\\n\\\"If anybody expects me to stay away from Institute this year, he has got\\na surprise coming, that's all.\\\"\\n\\nThe meeting was just breaking up, after a speech whose closing words had\\nbeen a shade less tactful than the occasion called for. But the last two\\nsentences of that speech made all the difference in the world to John\\nWesley, Jr.\\n\\nThe Epworth League of First Church, Delafield, was giving one of its\\nfairly frequent socials. The program had gone at top speed for more than\\nan hour. All that noise could do, re-enforced by that peculiar emanation\\nby youth termed \\\"pep,\\\" had been drawn upon to glorify a certain\\nforthcoming event with whose name everybody seemed to be familiar, for\\nall called it simply \\\"the Institute.\\\"\\n\\nPennants, posters, and photographs supplied a sort of pictorial noise,\\nthe better to advertise this evidently remarkable event, which, one\\nmight gather, was a yearly affair held during the summer vacation at the\\nseat of Cartwright College.\\n\\nThe yells and songs, the cheers and games and reminiscences, re-enforced\\nthe noisy decorations. At the last, in one of those intense moments of\\nquiet which young people can produce as by magic, came a neat little\\nspeech whose purpose was highly praiseworthy. But, to John Wesley, Jr.,\\nit ended on the wrong note. Another listener took mental exception to\\nit, though his anxiety proved to be groundless.\\n\\nIt was a recruiting speech, directed at anybody and everybody who had\\nnot yet decided to attend the Institute.\\n\\nThe speaker was, if anything, a trifle more cautious than canny when he\\ncame to his \\\"in conclusion,\\\" and his zeal touched the words with\\nanti-climax.\\n\\n\\\"Of course,\\\" he said, \\\"since ten, or at most twelve, is our quota, we\\nare not quite free to encourage the attendance of everybody,\\nparticularly of our younger members. They have hardly reached the age\\nwhere the Institute could be a benefit to them, and their natural\\ninclination to make the week a period of good times and mere pleasure\\nwould seriously interfere with the interests of others more mature and\\nserious minded.\\\"\\n\\nNow, the pastor of the church, the Rev. Walter Drury, would have put\\nthat differently, he said to himself. If it produced any bad effects it\\nwould need to be corrected, certainly.\\n\\nJust then, amid the inevitable applause, and the dismissal of the brief\\nformal assembly for the social half-hour, something snapped inside of\\nJohn Wesley, Jr., and it was the feeling of it which prompted him to\\nsay, \\\"If anybody expects me to stay away from Institute this year, he\\nhas got a surprise coming, that's all.\\\"\\n\\nYou see, John Wesley, Jr., had just been graduated from high school,\\nand his family expected him to go to college in the fall, though he\\nfaced that expectation without much enthusiasm. He felt his new freedom.\\nHe addressed his rebellious remark to the League president, Marcia\\nDayne, a sensible girl whom he had known as long as he had known anybody\\nin the church.\\n\\n\\\"Last year everybody said I was too young. They all talked the way he\\ndid just now. But they can't say I am too young now,\\\" and with that easy\\nskill which is one of the secrets of youth, he managed to contemplate\\nhimself, serenely conscious that he was personable and \\\"right.\\\"\\n\\nThe girl turned to him with a gesture of surprise.\\n\\n\\\"But I thought your father had agreed to let you take that trip to\\nChicago you have been saving up for. Will he let you go to the Institute\\ntoo?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Chicago can wait,\\\" said John Wesley, Jr., grandly. \\\"Dad did say I could\\ngo to Chicago to see my cousins, or I could go anywhere else that I\\nwanted. Well, I am going to the Institute. It's my money, and, besides,\\nI am tired of being told I am too young. A fellow's got to grow up some\\ntime.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's all right,\\\" said Marcia, \\\"but what's your special interest in\\nthe Institute? Do you truly want to go? How do you know what an\\nInstitute is like?\\\"\\n\\nHer voice carried further than Marcia thought, and a man who seemed a\\nlittle too mature to be one of the young people, turned toward her. He\\nwas smiling, and any time these four years the town would have told you\\nthere wasn't a friendlier smile inside the city limits. He was in\\nbusiness dress, and suggested anything but the parson in his bearing,\\nbut through and through he looked the good minister that he was.\\n\\nMarcia moved toward him with an unspoken appeal. She wanted help. He was\\nwaiting for that signal, for he depended a good deal on Marcia. And he\\nwas still worried about that unlucky speech.\\n\\n\\\"Well, Marcia, are you telling J.W. what the Institute really is?\\\" he\\nasked.\\n\\n\\\"No, Mr. Drury, I'm not. I'm too much surprised at finding that he's\\nabout decided to go. You're just in time to tell him for me. I want him\\nto get it right, and straight.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" the pastor responded, \\\"I'm glad of that. If he's really going,\\nhe'll find out that definitions are not descriptions. Now, our Saint\\nSheridan used to say that an Institute was a combination of college,\\ncircus, and camp meeting. I would venture a different putting of it. An\\nInstitute is a bit of young democracy in action. Its people play\\ntogether, for play's sake and for finding their honest human level. They\\nstudy together, to become decently intelligent about some of the real\\nbusiness of the kingdom of God, and how the church proposes to transact\\nthat business. They wait for new vision together, the Institute being a\\ngood time and a good place for seeing life clear and seeing it whole.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Marcia, \\\"that's exactly it, only I never could have found\\nquite the right words. Do you think J.W. will find it too poky and\\npreachy?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tell him to try it and see, as you did last year,\\\" said Pastor Drury.\\n\\n\\\"I'll risk that,\\\" said John Wesley, Jr., in his newly resolute mood.\\n\\nHe knew when to stop, this preacher. Particularly concerned as he was\\nabout John Wesley, Jr., he saw that this was one of the many times when\\nthat young man would need to work things out for himself. Marcia would\\ngive what help might be called for at the moment. The boy was turning\\ntoward the Institute; so far so good.\\n\\nTo-night was nearly four years from the beginning of his interest in\\nthis young fellow with the Methodist name. He was a special friend of\\nthe family, though no more so than of every family in the town which\\ngave him the slightest encouragement. To a degree which no one suspected\\nhe shared this family's secret hopes for its son and heir; and he\\ncherished hopes which even the Farwells could not suspect. Unless he was\\nmuch mistaken he had found the subject for his Experiment.\\n\\nThat mention of the Farwells needs to be explained. Of course \\\"John\\nWesley, Jr.,\\\" was only part of the boy's name. In full he was John\\nWesley Farwell, Jr., son of John Wesley Farwell, Sr., of the J.W.\\nFarwell Hardware Co. As a little fellow he had no chance to escape\\n\\\"Junior,\\\" since he was named for his father. There were many Jacks and\\nJohns and Johnnies about. His mother, good Methodist that she was,\\nsecretly enjoyed calling him \\\"John Wesley, Jr.,\\\" and before long the\\nneighbors and the neighborhood children followed her example.\\n\\nA little later he might have been teased out of it, but at the\\nimpossible age when boys discover that queer names and red hair and\\ncross-eyes make convenient excuses for mutual torture, it happened that\\nhe had attained to the leadership of his gang. For some reason he took\\npride in his two Methodist names, and made short work of those who\\nventured to take liberties with them. In all other respects he played\\nwithout reserve boyhood's immemorial game of give and take; but as to\\nhis name or any part thereof he would tolerate no foolishness and no\\nback talk. When he reached the high school period, however, most of his\\nintimates rarely called him by his full name, having, like all high\\nschool people, no time for long names, though possessed of infinite\\nleisure for long dreams. Straightway they shortened his name to \\\"J.W.,\\\"\\nwhich to this day is all that his friends find necessary.\\n\\nVery well, then; this is J.W. at eighteen; a young fellow worth\\nknowing. Take a look at him; impulsive, generous, not what you would\\ncall handsome, but possessed of a genial eye and a ready tongue, a\\nstubby nose and a few scattered freckles. A fair student, he is yet far\\nfrom bookishness, and he makes friends easily.\\n\\nOf late he has been paying furtive but detailed attention to his hair\\nand his neckties and the hang of his clothes, though still in small\\ndanger of being mistaken for a tailor's model.\\n\\nWith such a name you will understand that he's a Methodist by first\\nintention; born so. He is a pretty sturdy young Christian, showing it in\\na boy's modest but direct fashion, which even his teammates of the\\nhigh-school football squad found it no trouble to tolerate, because they\\nknew him for a human, healthy boy, and not a morbid, self-inspecting\\nreligious prig. Pastor Drury, you may be sure, had taken note of all\\nthat, for he and J.W. had been fast friends since the day he had\\nreceived the boy into the church.\\n\\nThe morning after the Institute social J.W. announced at breakfast his\\nsudden change of plan.\\n\\n\\\"If you don't mind, Dad, I've about decided to go to the Institute\\ninstead of Chicago. There is a bunch of us going, and Mr. Drury will be\\nthere. Uncle Henry's folks might not want to be bothered with me now,\\nand anyway I don't know them very well. But I can go to the Institute\\nwith the church crowd; and there will be tennis and swimming and plenty\\nof other fun besides the big program.\\\" Which was quite a speech for J.\\nW.\\n\\nJohn Wesley, Sr., didn't know much about the Institute, but he had an\\nendless regard for his pastor, and the mother was characteristically\\nwilling to postpone her boy's introduction to the unknown and, in her\\nthought, therefore, the menacing city.\\n\\nSo, after the brief but unhurried devotions at the breakfast table,\\nwhich had come to serve in place of the old-time family prayers,\\nparental approval was forthcoming. And thus it befell that J.W.\\nselected for himself a future whose every experience was to be affected\\nby so slight a matter as his impulsive choice of a week's holiday. That\\nchoice expressed to him the new freedom of his years, for he had not\\neven been conscious of the quiet influence which had made it easier than\\nhe knew to decide as he had done.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nIt was a mixed and lively company that found itself crowded around the\\nregistrar's table at the Institute one Monday evening in July, with J.\\nW. and his own particular chum, Martin Luther Shenk, better known as\\n\\\"Marty,\\\" right in the middle of it.\\n\\nJ.W. wondered where so many Epworthians could have come from. Did they\\nreally hanker after the Institute, or had they come for reasons as\\ntrivial as his own? He put the question to Martin Luther Shenk.\\n\\n\\\"Marty, do you reckon these are all here for real Epworth League work,\\nor does the Institute want anybody and everybody?\\\"\\n\\nMarty had been scouting a little, and he answered: \\\"No, to both\\nquestions, I should say. Some have come just to be coming, and others\\nseem to be here for business. But I saw Joe Carbrook just now, and if he\\nis an Epworth Leaguer I am the Prince of Puget Sound. You know how he\\nstands at home. Wonder what he came for.\\\"\\n\\nJust then Joe Carbrook himself came up. He was from Delafield too,\\nmember of the same League chapter as the two chums, but he had rarely\\ncondescended to league affairs. Having had two rather variegated years\\nat college, he felt he must show his sophistication by holding himself\\nabove some of those simple old observances.\\n\\n\\\"S'pose you are here for solemn and serious work, you two,\\\" he remarked\\nmockingly, as he saw the boys. \\\"I just met Marcia Dayne, and she told me\\nyou were registering. Well, I'm here too--drove up in my car--but you\\ndon't catch me tying myself down to all that study stuff. I'm looking\\nfor fun, not work.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nothing new for you in that, Joe,\\\" said Marty. \\\"But I should think you\\nmight try the study stuff, if only for a change, after you have spent\\ngood money on gas and tires. And you have to pay for your meals, you\\nknow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I studied hard enough last month in college cramming for the\\nfinal exams, so I could get within gunshot of enough sophomore credits,\\nand I'm through; with study for a while. If I find a few live ones in\\nthis crowd, I guess we can enjoy ourselves without interfering with any\\nof you grinds, if you must study,\\\" and Joe Carbrook went off in search\\nof his live ones.\\n\\nJ.W. and Marty were in no hurry to register. The crowd milling around\\nin the office was interesting, and J.W. was still wondering how many of\\nthem, himself included, would get enough Institute long before the week\\nwas over. Besides, it was yet an hour before supper.\\n\\n\\\"Think of it, Marty. All these people come from Epworth Leagues just\\nlike ours, from Springfield, and Wolf Prairie and Madison and all over\\nthis part of the State. What for, I'd like to know? Will you look at\\nthose pennants? Wish we had brought one or two of ours; we could add to\\nthe display, anyway.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have two in my suitcase,\\\" said Marty. \\\"We'll have them out this\\nevening at the introduction meeting. And maybe you'll find out 'what\\nfor' by that time.\\\"\\n\\nThe introduction meeting in the chapel after supper was for the most\\npart informal. Yells and songs and the waving of pennants punctuated the\\nproceedings, as is quite the proper thing in an Epworth League\\ngathering. Some people, who see only what is on the surface, cannot\\nwholly understand the exuberance of an Epworth League crowd. But it has\\nroots in something very real.\\n\\nThe dean of the Institute managed, amid the roystering and the intervals\\nof attention, to set things up for the week. A few regulations would\\nneed to be laid down; and these would be fixed, not by the faculty or by\\nthe dean, but by the Student Council. Would each district group please\\nget together at once, and select some one to represent the group on this\\ncouncil?\\n\\nThis request being obeyed amid considerable confusion, with Marcia Dayne\\nappointed from the Fort Adams District, and the council excused to draft\\nthe basic laws for the week, the faculty was introduced, one by one.\\n\\nEach teacher was given the opportunity to describe his or her course, so\\nthat out of the eight or nine courses offered every delegate might\\nselect two besides the two which were required of all students, and so\\nqualify for an Institute diploma.\\n\\nJ.W. found himself enjoying all this hugely. It appealed to his growing\\nsense of freedom from schoolboy restraint. If he did go to any of the\\nclasses, it appeared that he could pick the ones he liked. Up to now he\\nhad entertained no thought of any serious work, but the faculty talks\\nabout these courses made him think there might be worse ways of spending\\nthe week than qualifying for an Institute diploma. The whole thing\\nseemed to be so easy and so friendly. Of course he could see that the\\nstudy would not be much, even if he signed up for it, being just for a\\nweek, but it might not be bad fun.\\n\\nMorning Watch was an experience to J.W. He was surprised to find\\nhimself staying awake in a before-breakfast religious meeting, and was\\neven more surprised to be enjoying it. Something about this big crowd of\\nyoung people stirred all his pulses, and the religion they heard about\\nand talked about seemed to J.W. something very real and desirable. He\\nthought of himself as a Christian, but he wondered if his Christian life\\nmight not become more confident and productive. In this atmosphere one\\nalmost felt that anything was possible.\\n\\nMeal times turned out to be times of orderly disorder. J.W. and his\\nfriends were at a table with other groups from the Fort Adams District,\\nand he quickly mastered the raucous roar which served the District for a\\nyell. Before the end of the second day his alert good nature made him\\ncheer leader, and thereafter he rarely had time to eat all that was set\\nbefore him, though possessed of a boy's healthy appetite. It was simply\\nthat the other possibilities of the hour seemed more alluring than mere\\nfood.\\n\\nFrom the first day of the class work J.W. found himself keen for all\\nthat was going on. There was variety enough so that he felt no\\nweariness, and the range of new interests opened up each day kept him at\\nconstant and pleasurable attention. Without knowing just how, he was\\ncatching the Institute spirit.\\n\\nHe walked away from the dining hall one noon with his pastor-friend, and\\nhe talked. He had to talk to somebody, and Walter Drury contrived to\\nknow of his need.\\n\\n\\\"Why, Mr. Drury,\\\" he said, eagerly, \\\"I'm just finding out how little I\\nknow about the church and real Christian work. I thought I was something\\nof an average Methodist boy, but if the people at home are no better\\nthan I am, I can see how being a preacher to such a bunch is a man's\\njob.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Correct, J.W.\\\" said the minister. \\\"I find that out many a time, to my\\nhumbling. But honestly, now, are you learning things you never knew\\nbefore?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ye-es, I am,\\\" J.W. answered, \\\"and then, again, I'm not. It seems to me\\nas if I had always known a lot of what we are getting in these classes,\\nthough there is plenty of new stuff too. But until now I didn't get much\\nout of what I knew. I've always liked to hear you, but you're different.\\nAs for most of the things I've heard, I just thought of it as religious\\ntalk, church stuff, you know. It didn't seem to matter, but here it is\\nbeginning to matter in all sorts of ways, and I can see that it matters\\nto me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How, for instance?\\\"\\n\\nWell, take the class in home missions; Americanization, they call it.\\nMaybe you noticed that the first thing the teacher did was to divide the\\nclass right down the middle, and tell those on the left hand--yes, I'm\\none of the goats--that for the rest of the week they were to consider\\nthemselves aliens. The others were to play native-born Americans. And so\\nthe study started, but believe me, we aliens have already begun to make\\nit interesting for those natives. Some of 'em want to come over on our\\nside already, but they can't. A few of us have found some immigration\\ndope in the college library, and it is pretty strong. We'll show up\\nthose Pilgrim Fathers before the week is out. They think they have done\\neverything an alien could ask when they let him into the country, and\\nthen they work him twelve hours a day, seven days a week, or else let\\nhim hunt the country over for any sort of a job. They rob him by making\\nhim pay higher prices than other people for all he has to buy. They\\nforce him to live in places not fit for rats, and on top of everything\\nelse they call him names, so that their kids stick up their noses at his\\nchildren in the school grounds. After all that they expect he'll become\\na good citizen just by hearing 'The Star-Spangled Banner' at the movies\\nand watching the flag go by when there's a parade.\\n\\n\\\"Say, Mr. Drury, it makes me sick, and, if I feel that way just to be\\npretending I'm a 'Wop' for a week, how do you suppose the real aliens\\nfeel? Excuse me for talking like this, but honestly, something like that\\nis going on in all these classes; I wish we could take up such things in\\nthe League at home.\\\" And he forced an embarrassed little laugh.\\n\\nPastor Drury laughed too, and said of course they could, as he linked\\narms with J.W., and they passed on down the road. The preacher talked\\nbut little, contriving merely to drop a question now and then; and J.W.\\ntalked on, half-ashamed to be so \\\"gabby,\\\" as he put it, and yet moved by\\nan impulse as pleasant as it was novel.\\n\\n\\\"And foreign missions, Mr. Drury. You won't be offended, I hope, but\\nsomehow as far back as I can remember I have always connected foreign\\nmissions with collections and 'Greenland's Icy Mountains' and little\\nnaked Hottentots, and something--I don't know just what--about the River\\nGanges. But here--why, that China class just makes me want to see China\\nfor myself and find out how much of the advantages of American life over\\nChinese has come on account of religion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, why not, J.W.? Maybe you will go to China some day, and have a\\nhand in it all,\\\" suggested the pastor, to try him out.\\n\\nThe boy shook his head.\\n\\n\\\"No, I don't think so. I am certainly getting a new line on foreign\\nmissions, but I don't think there's missionary stuff in me. I'll have\\nto go at the proposition some other way.\\\"\\n\\nThen Pastor Drury set him going on another subject.\\n\\n\\\"What do you think of the young folks who are here?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"Well, at first I thought they were all away ahead of our bunch at home,\\nand some of them are; but you soon find out that the majority is pretty\\nmuch of the same sort as ours. I think I've spotted a few slackers, but\\nmighty few. Most of the crowd seems to be all right, and I've already\\nmade some real friends. But do you know which one of them all is the\\nmost interesting fellow I've met?\\\"\\n\\nThe pastor thought he did, but he merely asked, \\\"Who?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, that Greek boy, Phil Khamis. He is from Salonika, you know. He\\nknows the old country like a book, and he's going back some day, maybe\\nto be some kind of missionary to his people, in the very places where\\nthe apostle Paul preached. Honest, I never knew until he told me that\\nhis Salonika is the town of those Christians to whom Paul wrote two of\\nhis letters; those to the Thessalonians--'Thessalonika,' you know. Well,\\nyou ought to hear Phil talk. He came over here seven years ago, and\\nlearned the English language from the preacher at Westvale.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I have heard about him,\\\" said Mr. Drury. \\\"They say he lived in the\\nparsonage and paid the preacher for his English lessons by giving him a\\nnew understanding of the Greek New Testament. Not many of us have found\\nout yet how to get such pay for being decent to our friends from the\\nother side.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, he is a thoroughbred, anyway; and do you notice how he is right\\nup in front when there is anything doing? The only way you can tell he\\nisn't American born is that he is so anxious to help out on all the\\nunpleasant work. When I look at Phil it makes me boil to think of\\nfellows like him being called 'Wop.'\\\"\\n\\nBy this time the two had swung back into the campus, and J.W. found\\nhimself drafted to hold down second base in the Faculty-Student ball\\ngame. But that is a story for others to tell.\\n\\nOn the steps of the library Marcia Dayne and some other girls were\\nholding an informal reception. Joe Carbrook, with one or two of his\\nfriends, was finding it agreeable to assume a superior air concerning\\nthe Institute. The impression the boys gave was that their coming to the\\nInstitute at all had been a great concession, but that they were under\\nno illusions about the place.\\n\\n\\\"All this is all right,\\\" Joe was saying, \\\"for those who need it, but\\nwhat's the good of it all to us? For instance, what do you get out of\\nit, Marcia?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you think I want to get out of it? If you cared for the young\\npeople's work at home, I should think you could see how 'all this,' as\\nyou call it, would help you to do better work and more of it at\\nDelafield.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As you ought to know pretty well, Marcia,\\\" Joe replied, \\\"back home they\\nthink I don't care much for the young people's work. It is a little too\\nprim and ready-to-wear for me, if you'll excuse me for saying so. No fun\\nin it at all, though I'll admit some of the classes here have more life\\nin them than I looked for.\\\"\\n\\nOne of the other girls, who knew him well enough to speak with large\\nfrankness, came to the defense of them all, saying: \\\"Well, Joe, I don't\\nsee that you get very far with what you call fun. It's mostly at the\\nexpense of other people, including your father, who pays the bills.\\nBesides, since you came home from college this spring, you seem to have\\nrun out of nearly all the bright ideas you started with. I wonder if it\\never strikes you that being a sport, as you call it, is mostly being a\\nnuisance to everybody? Some of us long ago got over thinking you clever\\nand original. You must be getting over it yourself, by now, surely.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Many thanks, dear lady, for them kind words,\\\" Joe responded, as he\\nbowed low in mock acknowledgment; \\\"you make yourself quite plain, Miss\\nAlma Wetherell.\\\" He flung back the insult jauntily, as he and his\\ncompanions moved on, but at least one of the group suspected that the\\nwords had struck home.\\n\\nYou who know the General Secretary could easily forgive J.W. his\\ndelight in the class of which the program said the subject was\\n\\\"Methods.\\\" This is the only hour in an Institute which the Epworth\\nLeague takes for its own work. Rightly enough, it is a crowded hour,\\nwith the whole Institute present, and usually it is an hour of\\nunflagging interest.\\n\\nJ.W. and Marty were enjoying their first Institute too much to be late\\nat any classes. They were merely a little earlier at this class; to miss\\nany of it would be a distinct loss.\\n\\nNow, what the General Secretary talked about was no more than the\\neveryday work of the League--how it meant the young people of the church\\nand their work for and with young people for the sake of the future. But\\nhe had a way with him. He said the League was a great scheme of self,\\nwith the \\\"ish\\\" left off. In the League one practiced self-help, and\\nenjoyed the twin luxuries of self-direction and self-expression, and\\ncame sooner or later to that strange new knowledge which is\\nself-discovery. He explained how Epworthians as such could live on\\ntwenty-four hours a day, the plan being an ingenious and yet simple\\nfinancial arrangement for keeping the League work moving, both where you\\nare and where you aren't, even around the world. He had innumerable\\nstories of the devotional meeting idea, the Win-My-Chum idea, the\\nstewardship idea, the Institute idea, the life service idea, the\\nrecreation idea, the study-class idea, and every other League idea so\\nfar invented.\\n\\nBut all this is merely a hint of what the General Secretary meant to the\\nInstitute, and particularly to the delegates from Delafield. Even Joe\\nCarbrook had been impressed. He heard the General Secretary the morning\\nafter that little exchange of compliments on the library steps, and for\\nan hour thereafter let himself enjoy the rare luxury of thinking. The\\nresults were somewhat disconcerting.\\n\\n\\\"It's funny,\\\" said Marty, as the four of them, the other three being\\nJoe, Marcia, and J.W., sat under a tree in the afternoon, \\\"but I believe\\nthat man could make even trigonometry interesting. I thought I'd heard\\nall that could be said about the devotional meeting; but did you get\\nthat scheme for leaders he sprung this morning? Watch me when we get\\nback home, that's all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You needn't suppose you are the only one who got it,\\\" said Marcia.\\n\\\"Everybody was trying to watch the General Secretary and to take notes\\nat the same time, and I don't believe you are any quicker at that than\\nthe rest of us. Of course all of us will use as many of his ideas as we\\ncan remember, when we get home again.\\\"\\n\\nJoe Carbrook, with a new seriousness which sat awkwardly on him,\\nconfessed that he could not understand just what was happening. It was\\nevident that he was ill at ease; Marcia had noticed it every time she\\nhad seen him since that encounter with Alma Wetherell.\\n\\n\\\"I guess you folks know I am not easily caught; but I'm ready to admit\\nthat man has hold of something. Yes, and I'm half convinced that this\\nInstitute has hold of something. I wish I knew what it is. If I could\\nreally believe that all I hear and see at this place is part of being\\nyoung and part of being a Christian, I might be thinking before long\\nabout getting into the game myself. The trouble is you three and the\\nother Leaguers I've watched at home are just you three and the others,\\nand that's all. I know, and you know, what you can do. You'll take all\\nthese ideas of League work and use them, maybe; but what I can't see is\\nhow you will pick up the Big Idea of this place and get back home\\nwithout losing it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We can't,\\\" said Marcia, \\\"not without all sorts of help, visible and\\ninvisible. You, for instance; if you would really get into the game, as\\nyou say, nobody could guess how much it would mean to our League. And it\\nmight mean more to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marcia's right about that,\\\" said J.W. \\\"The Big Idea of this place, that\\nyou speak of, is a lot too big for us to take home alone. Maybe you'll\\nthink I'm preaching, but I don't care, if I say that for God to handle\\nalone, it is not big enough. He makes the stars, and gives us his Son,\\nwithout any help from us. Nobody else can do that. But he won't make our\\nLeague at home a success without us; and all of us together can't do it\\nwithout Him. I'm not saying I know how to do it, even then, but that's\\nthe way it looks to me. Why, Joe,\\\" he said with sudden intensity as he\\nfaced Joe Carbrook, \\\"if you ever get hold of the Big Idea, and the Big\\nIdea gets hold of you, something is sure to happen, something bigger\\nthan any of us can figure out now. I know you have it in you.\\\"\\n\\nAll four showed a surprised self-consciousness over J.W.'s unexpected\\nventure into these rather deeper conversational waters than usual, and\\nthere was more surprise when Joe Carbrook began to talk about himself.\\n\\nHe laughed to hide a touch of embarrassment, but with little mirth; and\\nthen he said, \\\"Well, J.W., that's not all foolishness, though I don't\\nsee why you should pick on me. Why not Marty? Of course, I came here for\\nfun, and I have had some, though not just the sort I expected. And I've\\nhad several jolts too. I might as well admit that if I could just only\\nsee how you hitch all of this League and church business to real life, I\\nwould be for it with all I've got. The trouble is, while I've never been\\nespecially proud of my own record, neither have I seen much excuse yet\\nfor what you 'active members' have been busy with. I have been playing\\nmy way, and you have been playing yours; but it all seems mostly play to\\nme. All the same, I guess I am getting tired of my kind.\\\" If Joe could\\never have spoken wistfully, you might have suspected him of it just\\nthen.\\n\\nClearly, thought Marcia Dayne, in the silence that followed, something\\nbig was already happening. But how to help it on she could not tell; so,\\nwith a desperate effort to do the right thing, she contrived to turn the\\nsubject It seemed to her it had become too difficult to go further just\\nnow without peril to Joe's strange new interest, as well as to a very\\nnew and tremulous little hope that had begun to sing in her own heart.\\n\\nThe shift of the talk was a true Institute change, and would have been\\nmost disconcerting to anyone unfamiliar with the ways of young\\nChristians; but Marcia was sure that what had been said would not be\\nforgotten, and she knew there would be another time.\\n\\nIt was this that made her say, \\\"I wish you boys would suggest what sort\\nof stunt our district should give on stunt night; you know the time is\\ngetting short.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's a fact,\\\" exclaimed Marty, sitting up. \\\"Stunt night is to-morrow,\\nand our delegation has to fix up the stunt for the Fort Adams District.\\nLet's get to work on something. We've been mooning long enough.\\\"\\n\\nFor though Marty never thought as quickly as Marcia, he too felt some\\ninstinct of fear lest by an unfortunate word they should break the spell\\nof Joe Carbrook's interest in the \\\"Big Idea,\\\" and promptly the four were\\ndeep in a study of stunts.\\n\\nTo the uninitiated, stunt night at the Institute is without rime or\\nreason, but not to those in charge who are looking ahead to Sunday. They\\nknow that the converging and cumulative psychic forces which the\\nInstitute invariably produces must be tempered, along about midway of\\nthe week, by some sharp contrast in the communal life. Otherwise, the\\ngroup, like over-trained athletes, will grow emotionally stale before\\nthe week is done, and at the end of that is let-down and flatness. Hence\\n\\\"stunt night.\\\"\\n\\nIn the early Institute years it was easy, as in some places it still is,\\nfor stunt night to be no more than clowning, witless and cheap; but\\nthere is a distinct tendency to exercise the imagination in producing\\nmore self-respecting efforts.\\n\\nCartwright, happily, is one of the forward-looking Institutes, and stunt\\nnight, crowded with most excellent fooling, produced two or three\\ncreditable and thought-provoking performances. One of them deserves\\nremembering for its own sake. Besides, it is a part of this story.\\n\\nThe home missions class furnished the inspiration for it, and called it\\n\\\"Scum o' the Earth,\\\" an impromptu immigration pageant. A boy who had\\nmemorized Schauffler's poem stood off stage and recited it, while group\\nafter group of \\\"immigrants\\\" in the motley of the steerage passed slowly\\nthrough the improvised Ellis Island sifting process. It was all\\nmake-believe, of course, all but one tense moment. Then Phil Khamis\\nstepped on the platform, incarnating in his own proper person the poet's\\napostrophised Greek boy:\\n\\n\\\"Stay, are we doing you wrong,\\n Young fellow from Socrates' land?\\nYou, like a Hermes so lissome and strong,\\n Fresh from the master Praxiteles' hand?\\nSo you're of Spartan birth?\\n Descended, perhaps, from one of the band--\\nDeathless in story and song--\\nWho combed their long hair at Thermopylae's pass?\\nAh, I forget the straits, alas!\\n More tragic than theirs, more compassion-worth,\\nThat have doomed you to march in our 'immigrant class'\\n Where you're nothing but 'scum o' the earth!'\\\"\\n\\nThe audience was caught unaware. It had been vastly interested in the\\nspectacle, as a spectacle, the more because the unusual Americanization\\nclass which produced it had attracted general attention. But, Phil\\nKhamis, everybody's friend, standing there, an immigrant of the\\nimmigrants, smiling his wistful friendly smile, was a picture as\\ndramatic as it was unexpected. First there were ejaculations of\\nastonishment and surprise. Then came the moment of understanding, and a\\nshining-eyed stillness fell on all. Then, what a shout! J.W. led off,\\nthe unashamed tears falling from his brimming eyes.\\n\\nOn Saturday morning J.W. was sitting beside Phil Khamis at Morning\\nWatch. The leader had asked for answers to the question \\\"Why did I come\\nto the Institute?\\\" getting several responses of the conventional sort.\\nSuddenly Phil nudged J.W. and whispered, \\\"Shall I tell why I came?\\\" and\\nJ.W. with the memory of stunt night's thrill not yet dulled, said\\npromptly, \\\"Sure, go ahead.\\\"\\n\\nWhen Phil got up an attentive silence fell upon them all. The Greek boy\\nhad made many friends, as much by his engaging frankness and anxiety to\\nlearn as by his perpetual eagerness to have a hand in every bit of hard\\nwork that turned up. Since the stunt night incident he was everybody's\\nfavorite.\\n\\n\\\"Friends,\\\" he said, in his rather careful, precise way, \\\"I am here for a\\ndifferent reason than any. When I was in America but a little time a\\nMethodist preacher made himself my friend. I could not speak English,\\nonly a few words. He took me to his home. He taught me to talk the\\nAmerican way. He find me other friends, though I could do nothing at all\\nfor them to pay them back. Now I am Christian--real, not only baptized.\\nThe young people of the church take me in to whatever they do. They\\ncall me 'Phil' and never care that I am a foreigner, so when I heard\\nabout this Institute I say to myself, 'It is something strange to me,\\nbut I hear that many people like those in my church will be there.' I\\ncannot quite believe that, but it sounded good, and I wanted to come and\\nsee. And now I know that many people are young people like those I first\\nknew. They treat me just the same. It makes me love America much more;\\nand if I could tell my people in the old country that all this good has\\ncome to me from the church, they could not believe it. Still, it is\\ntrue. Everything I have to-day has come to me by goodness of Christian\\npeople.\\\"\\n\\nThere were some half-embarrassed \\\"Amens,\\\" and more than one hitherto\\nunsuspected cold required considerable attention. All the way to\\nbreakfast Phil held embarrassed court, while his hand was shaken and his\\nshoulder was thumped and he was told, solo and chorus, by all who could\\nget near him, that \\\"He's all right!\\\"--\\\"Who's all right?\\\" \\\"Phil Khamis!\\\"\\n\\nBut J.W. was walking slowly toward the dining hall, alone. As he had\\nlistened to Phil, at first he thought, \\\"Good old scout, he's putting it\\nover,\\\" but by the time the Greek's simple words were ended, J.W. was\\nlooking himself straight in the eye. \\\"Young fellow,\\\" he was saying, \\\"you\\nhave come mighty near feeling glad that you have had so many more\\nadvantages than this stranger, and yet can't you see that what he says\\nabout himself is almost as true about you? All you have to-day--this\\nInstitute, your religion, your church, your friends, the kind of a home\\nyou have and are so proud of--everything has come to you by what Phil\\ncalls the goodness of Christian people.\\\"\\n\\nAnd then it was breakfast time, with an imperative call on J.W. from the\\nFort Adams table for \\\"that new yell we fixed up last night,\\\" and the\\nminutes in which he had talked with himself were for the time forgotten.\\nBut the memory of them came back in the days after the Institute was\\nitself a memory.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nThe Saturday night camp fire at this Institute, contrary to the usual\\ncustom, was not co-ed. The boys went down to the lake shore and sat\\naround a big fire on the sand. The girls had their fire on the slope of\\na hill at the other edge of the campus.\\n\\nNor does this Institute care for too much praise of itself. Its\\ntraditional spirit is to work more for outcomes than for the devices\\nwhich produce complacency. It stages only a few opportunities of telling\\n\\\"Why I like this Institute.\\\"\\n\\nSo, at the camp fires a man talked to the boys and a woman to the girls,\\nnot about the Institute, but about life. These speakers knew the strange\\neffect an Institute week has on impressionable and romantic youth; they\\nknew that by this time scores of the students were either saying to\\nthemselves, \\\"I've got to do something big before this thing's over,\\\" or\\nwere vainly trying to put the conviction away.\\n\\nThe woman who talked to the girls happened to be a preacher's wife.\\nThis gave her a certain advantage when she told the listening girls that\\nthe greatest of all occupations for them was not some special vocation,\\nbut what Ida Tarbell has called \\\"the business of being a woman.\\\" It was\\ngood preparation for the next day's program, with its specific and\\nglamorous appeal, for it put first the great claim, so that special\\nvocations could be seen in clear air and could be fairly measured.\\n\\nPastor Drury, who talked to the boys, was talking to them all, as J.W.\\nvery well knew, but every word seemed for him; as, indeed, it was, in a\\nsense that he did not suspect. He was not surprised that his pastor\\nshould present the Christian life as effectively livable by bricklayers\\nand business men as surely as by missionaries. He had heard that before.\\nBut to J.W. the old message had a new setting, a new force. And never\\nbefore had he been so ready to receive it.\\n\\nThe songs had sung themselves out, as the fire changed from roaring\\nflame and flying sparks to a great bed of living coals. From the world's\\nbeginning a glowing hearth has been perfect focus for straight thought\\nand plain speech. The boys found it so this night.\\n\\nThe minister began so simply that it seemed almost as if his voice were\\nonly the musings of many, just become audible. \\\"I know,\\\" said he, \\\"that\\nto-morrow some of you will find yourselves, and will eagerly offer your\\nlives for religious callings. We shall all be proud of you and glad to\\nsee it. But most of you cannot do that. You are already sure that you\\nmust be content to live 'ordinary Christian lives,' It is possible that\\nto-morrow you may feel a little out of the picture. And those who are\\nhearing a special call might regard you, quite unconsciously, of course,\\nas not exactly on their level.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now, suppose we get this thing straight to-night. There is no great nor\\nsmall, no high nor low, in real service. The differences are only in the\\nforms of work you do. The quality may be just as fine in one place as in\\nanother. The boy who goes into the ministry, or who becomes a medical\\nmissionary, will have peculiar chances for usefulness. So also will the\\nboy who goes into business or farming or teaching, or any other\\nso-called secular occupation. Just because he is not called to religious\\nwork as a daily business he dare not think that he has no call. God's\\ncalling is not for the few, but for the many. And just now the man who\\nputs his whole soul into being an out-and-out Christian in his daily\\nbusiness and in his personal life as a responsible citizen must have the\\ngenuine missionary spirit. He must live like a prophet, that is, a\\nmessenger from God. He must know the Christian meaning of all that\\nhappens in the world. And he must stand for the whole Christian program.\\nOtherwise, not all the ministers and missionaries in the world can save\\nour civilization. It is your chance of a great career. You who will make\\nup the rank and file of the Christian army in the next twenty-five\\nyears--do you know what you are? _You are the hope of the world!\\\"_\\n\\nAs the group broke up in the dim light of the dying embers, J.W.\\nstumbled into Joe Carbrook, and the two headed for the tents together.\\nThey had been on a much more friendly footing since Thursday.\\n\\n\\\"Say, J.W.,\\\" said Joe, abruptly, \\\"what's the matter with me? I came to\\nthis place without knowing just why; thought I'd just have a good time,\\nI suppose; but here I am being bumped up against something new and big\\nevery little while, until I wonder if it's the same world that I was\\nliving in before I came. Do you suppose anybody else feels that way? Is\\nit the place? Or the people? Or what?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't just know,\\\" said J.W., trying to keep from showing his\\nsurprise. \\\"I feel a good deal that way myself. I think it's maybe that\\nthis is the first time we've ever been forced to look squarely at some\\nof the things that seem so natural here. At home it's easy to dodge. You\\nknow that, only you've dodged one way and I've done it another.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But do you feel different, the way I do, J.W.? Do you feel like saying\\nto yourself: 'Looka here, Joe Carbrook, quit being a fool. See what you\\ncould do if you settled down to getting ready for something real. Like\\nbeing a doctor, now.' Do _you_ feel that way? You don't know it, but\\nI've always thought I could be a doctor, if I could see anything in it.\\nAnd then the other side of me speaks up and says: 'Joe Carbrook, don't\\nkid yourself. You know you haven't got the nerve to try, even if you had\\nthe grit to stick it through.' Is it that way with you, J.W.? You've\\npaid more attention to religion and all that than I ever did. And what\\nyou said on Thursday about the 'Big Idea' has kept me guessing ever\\nsince.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Joe, my trouble's not like yours. I know I can't be a doctor, nor a\\npreacher, nor a missionary. I've got nothing of that in me. But what we\\nheard to-night at the camp fire came straight at me. As I tried to say\\nthe other day, if you get the 'Big Idea' of the Institute, Christian\\nservice looks like a great life. But me--I've no hope to be anything\\nparticular; just one of the crowd. And I never quite saw until to-night\\nhow that might be a great life too.\\\"\\n\\nAs they were parting, J.W. ventured a bold suggestion. \\\"Say, Joe, if you\\nthink you could be a doctor, _why not a missionary doctor?\\\"_\\n\\nJoe's answer was a swift turning on his heel, and he strode away with\\nnever a word.\\n\\n\\\"Probably made him mad,\\\" thought J.W. \\\"I wonder why I said it. Joe's the\\nlast boy in the world to have any such notion. But--well, something's\\nalready begun to happen to him, that's sure--and to me too.\\\"\\n\\nOn Sunday the little world of the Institute assumed a new and no less\\nattractive aspect. Everybody was dressed for Sunday, as at home. Classes\\nwere over; and games also; the dining room became for the first time a\\nplace of comparative quiet, with now and then the singing of a great old\\nhymn, just to voice the Institute consciousness.\\n\\nThe Morning Watch talk had been a little more direct, a little more\\ntense. And before the Bishop's sermon came the love feast. Now, the\\nMethodists of the older generation made much of their love feasts, but\\nin these days, except at the Annual Conference, an occasional Institute\\nis almost the only place where it flourishes with something of the\\nancient fervor.\\n\\nMany changes have come to Methodism since the great days of the love\\nfeast; changes of custom and thought and speech. But your ardent young\\nMethodist of any period, Chaplain McCabe, Peter Cartwright, Jesse Lee,\\nCaptain Webb, would have understood and gloried in this Institute love\\nfeast. It spoke their speech.\\n\\nOur group from Delafield will never forget it.\\n\\nNearly all of them spoke; Marcia Dayne first because she was usually\\nexpected to lead in everything of the sort, then Marty, then J.W., and,\\nlast of all and most astounding, Joe Carbrook.\\n\\nMarty looked the soldier, and he put his confession into military terms.\\nHe spoke about his Captain and waiting for orders, and a new\\nunderstanding of obedience.\\n\\nBefore J.W. got his chance to speak, the leader read a night letter from\\nan Institute far away, conveying the greetings of six hundred young\\npeople to their fellow Epworthians.\\n\\nJ.W. could not bring himself to speak in terms of personal experience.\\nHe was still under the spell of last night's camp fire, and his brief\\nencounter with Joe Carbrook, but without quite knowing what could\\npossibly come of all that. And the telegram gave him an excuse to speak\\nin another vein. You must remember that up to now he had been wholly\\nlocal in his League interests. He had gone to no conventions, he was not\\na reader of _The Epworth Herald_, and to him the Central Office was as\\nthough it had not been.\\n\\n\\\"I wonder if anybody else feels as I do,\\\" he said, \\\"about this League of\\nours? Until this last week I never thought much about it. But we've just\\nheard that telegram from an Institute bigger than this, a thousand miles\\noff. And there's fifty-five or sixty Institutes going on this year,\\nbesides the winter Institutes, the conventions, and all the other\\ngatherings. We seem to belong to a movement that enrolls almost a\\nmillion young people, with all sorts of chances to learn how it can do\\nall sorts of Christian work by actually _doing_ it. This isn't the only\\nthing I've found out here, but it makes me want to see the whole League\\nbecome as good as it is big. I don't want to be dazzled by the size of\\nit, because I know how many other members are just as little use as I've\\nbeen. Only when I get home I hope I'm going to be a different sort of an\\nEpworthian, and I can't help wishing that we all felt that way about\\nbeing more good in the League. We can make it a hundred times more\\nuseful to the church and to our Master.\\\"\\n\\nMany others spoke like that, some of them because they could find\\nnothing more intimate to say, some here and there those who, like J.W.,\\ncould not quite trust themselves yet to talk of their deeper personal\\nexperiences.\\n\\nAnd then Joe Carbrook arose. He spoke easily, as Joe always did, but it\\nwas a new Joe Carbrook, and only the Delafield delegation understood how\\namazing was the change.\\n\\n\\\"This Institute has made me all sorts of trouble,\\\" he said. \\\"I had\\nnothing else to do, and without caring anything about it, except to get\\nsome new fun out of it, I came along, intending to stir up some of you\\nif I could, and I knew I could. But I've seen what a fool I was. Every\\nday I've seen that a little more distinctly. And last night, just as I\\nwas leaving one of the boys after the camp fire he said something about\\nwhat I might do with my life. I don't know how seriously he meant it.\\nMaybe he doesn't, either. I went off without answering him. There wasn't\\nany answer, except that I knew I wasn't fit even to think about it. And\\nthen, thank God, I met a man who understood what was wrong with me. He's\\nour pastor. I haven't been anything but trouble to him at home, but that\\nmade no difference to him. And he introduced me, down yonder by the\\nlake, to a Friend I had never known before, some one infinitely\\nunderstanding, infinitely forgiving. He showed me that before I could\\nfind what I ought to be I'd have to come to terms with that Friend. And\\nI have. Whatever happens to me, whatever I may find to do, I want now\\nand here for the first time in my life to confess Jesus Christ as my\\nSaviour and Lord!\\\"\\n\\nThe Bishop preached a great sermon, but it is doubtful whether the\\nDelafield delegation rightly appreciated it. They were too much\\noccupied with the incredible fact that Joe Carbrook had been converted,\\nand had openly confessed it.\\n\\nMore was to come. The afternoon meeting, long established in the\\nInstitute world as the \\\"Life Work Service,\\\" was in the hands of a few\\nleaders who knew both its power and peril. An invitation would be given\\nfor all to declare their purpose who felt called to special Christian\\nwork. The difficulty was to encourage the most timid of those who,\\ndespite their timidity, felt sure of the inner voice, and yet prevent a\\nstampede among those who, without any depth of desire, were in love with\\nemotion, and would enjoy being conspicuous, if only for the brief moment\\nof the service.\\n\\nFor once a woman made the address--a wise woman, let it be said, who\\nmade skillful and sure distinctions between the Christian life as a life\\nand the work of the Christian Church as one way of living that life.\\n\\nIt would have been a successful afternoon in any case, but three\\nincidents helped the speaker. When she asked those to declare themselves\\nwho had decided for definite Christian work, young people in all parts\\nof the room arose, and one after another they spoke, for the most part\\nsimply and modestly, of their hope and purpose. And Joe Carbrook was\\namong them!\\n\\nHe said very little, the nub of it being that he had always thought of\\nbeing a doctor, but not until a chance remark made by John Wesley, Jr.,\\nlast night had the idea appeared to him important. Just to make one more\\namong the thousands of doctors in America was one thing, he said. It\\nwas quite another to think of being the only physician among a great,\\nhelpless population. But to be a missionary doctor a man had to be first\\na missionary. And how could he be a missionary if he were not a\\nChristian? Well, as he had confessed at the love feast, that was settled\\nlast night, and as soon as it had been attended to be knew there was\\nnothing else in the way. So he must work now toward being a medical\\nmissionary.\\n\\nJoe's declaration stirred the whole assembly. And while the influence of\\nit was still on them, J.W. saw Martin Luther Shenk, his classmate and\\ndoubly his chum since a memorable day of the preceding October, get up\\nand quietly announce his purpose of becoming a minister. \\\"And I hope,\\\"\\nsaid Marty, \\\"that I may find my lifework in some of the new home mission\\nfields we have been learning about this week.\\\"\\n\\nAt that point the leader felt more than a little anxious. These two\\ndecisions, with all their restraint, had in them something infectious,\\nand she feared lest some young people, not holding themselves perfectly\\nin hand, might be moved to sentimental and unreflecting declaration.\\n\\nIf there had been any such danger, Marcia Dayne dispelled it. She was\\nall aglow with a new joy of her own, whose secret none knew but herself,\\nthough one other had almost dared to hope he could guess.\\n\\n\\\"May I speak?\\\" she asked. \\\"I have no decision to make for myself. Last\\nyear I took the 'Whatever, whenever, wherever' pledge, and I intend to\\nkeep it, though I am not yet sure what it will mean. But I know a boy\\nhere who will not talk unless somebody asks him, and there's a reason\\nwhy I think he should be asked. Please, mayn't we hear from John Wesley\\nFarwell, Jr., about _his_ kind of a call?\\\"\\n\\nJ.W., taken unawares at the mention of his name, was still at a loss\\nwhen the leader seconded Marcia's invitation; and the knowledge that he\\nwas expected to say something unusual did not make for self-control. But\\nhe understood Marcia's purpose, and tried to pull himself together.\\n\\n\\\"Miss Dayne is president of our home Chapter, and she had a lot to do\\nwith my coming to the Institute,\\\" he began. \\\"She has heard me talk since\\nI found out a little about the Institute, and I told her this morning\\nsomething of what Joe Carbrook and I had discussed last night after the\\ncamp fire.\\\"\\n\\nWell, to get to the point, I think she wants me to say, and I'm saying\\nit to myself most of all, that for nearly all of us young people,\\nChristian lifework must mean making an honest living, doing all we can\\nto make our religion count at home, and then backing up with all we've\\ngot, by prayer and money and brains, all these others like Joe Carbrook\\nand Marty Shenk, who are going into the hardest places to put up the\\nbiggest fight that's in them. We've just got to do it, or be quitters.\\nAs Phil Khamis said at Morning Watch yesterday, 'Everything we have has\\ncome to us by the goodness of Christian people.' We aren't willing to be\\nthe last links of that chain.\\n\\nWe don't want any special recognition, but I hope the Bishop and the\\nGeneral Secretary and the Dean and all the rest of the League leaders\\nwill know they can count on us just as we know they can count on these\\nfriends of ours who have just become life service volunteers.\\n\\nNobody knows what might have happened if some one had not spoken like\\nthat, but as the group of new volunteers stood about the platform at the\\nclose of the meeting, the other young people, instead of wandering off\\nand feeling themselves of no significance, came crowding about them, to\\nsay to them, boy-and-girl fashion, something of what J.W.'s little\\nspeech had suggested. Out of some four hundred Epworthians enrolled in\\nthe Institute, about forty had made definite decisions; but certainly\\nnot less than two hundred more had also faced the future, and in some\\nsort had made a new contract with themselves and with God.\\n\\nThe Institute ended there, except for a simple vesper service after the\\nevening meal, and on Monday morning the whole company was homeward\\nbound.\\n\\nThe Delafield delegation had separated. The larger group went home by\\ntrain, but Joe Carbrook's insistence was not to be withstood, so J.W.\\nand Marty, Marcia Dayne and Pastor Drury were Joe's passengers for the\\nfifty-odd miles between Institute and home.\\n\\nThey sang, they cheered, they yelled the Institute yells. They lived\\nover the crowded days of the week that had so swiftly passed. But most\\nof all they deeply resolved that so far as they could help to do it\\nwhile they were at home the League Chapter of Delafield should be made\\nover into something of more use to the church to which it belonged.\\n\\nIt was Marty who put their purpose into the fewest words. \\\"We, and the\\nothers who have been to the Institute, don't think we know every little\\nLeague thing,\\\" said he, \\\"and we don't think we are the whole League\\neither. But every time anybody in our Chapter starts anything good, he's\\ngoing to have more and better help than he ever had before.\\\"\\n\\nWhich thing came to pass, as may one day be recorded. The Rev. Walter\\nDrury kept his own counsel, but he knew that more had happened than the\\nputting of new life into the League. The Experiment had progressed\\nsafely through some most difficult stages.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nJOHN WESLEY, JR.'S BRINGING UP\\n\\nThose words of Phil Khamis at Morning Watch kept popping into J.W.'s\\nhead in the days following the Institute--\\\"Everything I have to-day has\\ncome to me by the goodness of Christian people.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know that must be true,\\\" he would say to himself, \\\"but it's worth\\ntracing back.\\\"\\n\\nThe preacher was coming over to supper one night, as he loved to do; and\\nJ.W. made up his mind to bring Phil's idea into the table talk. He was\\non even better terms with the preacher than he used to be.\\n\\nJ.W.'s mother hadn't said much about the Institute, though she had\\nlistened eagerly to all his talk of the crowded week, and she was\\nvaguely ill at ease. She had hoped for something, she did not know just\\nwhat, from the Institute, and she was not yet sure whether she ought to\\nfeel disappointed.\\n\\nBut she provided a fine supper, to which the menfolk paid the most\\npractical and sincere of all compliments. And since nobody had anything\\nelse on for the evening, there was plenty of time for talk.\\n\\nThe mother had a moment aside with the minister, and there was a touch\\nof anxiety in her question: \\\"Do you think the Institute helped my boy?\\\"\\n\\nAnd the pastor had just time to whisper back, \\\"It helped him much, but\\nhe gave even more help than he got You have reason to be proud of him. I\\nam. He's growing.\\\"\\n\\nIt was not very definite, but it brought no small comfort to the\\nmother's heart.\\n\\n\\\"This Institute idea seems to be everywhere,\\\" said J.W., Sr., to the\\npastor, \\\"but how did it get started? I used to be in the Epworth League,\\nbut we had nothing like it then.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's not so very much of a story,\\\" said the pastor. \\\"We have the\\nInstitute idea because we had to have it. And so the League gave it form\\nand substance.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" J.W., Jr., chimed in, \\\"I think it's about time more people knew\\nabout it. I've wanted to ask you to explain it ever since we came back\\nfrom the Institute.\\\"\\n\\nThe pastor nodded. \\\"I know; but remember even you were not really\\ninterested until you had been at an Institute. Do you think our\\nInstitute just happened, J.W.?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know it didn't,\\\" J.W. replied. \\\"Somebody did a lot of planning and\\nscheming.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" returned the pastor, \\\"but did you notice that a large part of its\\nwork touched subjects familiar to you, the local League activities, for\\ninstance--the devotional meeting, and Mission Study, and stewardship,\\nand the scope of the business meeting which not so long ago elected you\\nto membership?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, you're right, though I don't see anything remarkable in that. It\\nwas a League Institute, wasn't it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly. But still, if there had not been any local Chapter, there\\ncould have been no Institute, don't you see? What I mean is that the\\nInstitute came because your Chapter needed it, and you needed it; not\\nbecause the Institute needed you. It's merely a matter of tracing\\nthings back.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W., Jr., thought of Phil's words. \\\"Sure enough,\\\" he responded,\\n\\\"tracing things back makes a lot of difference. I've been going over\\nwhat Phil Khamis said at the Morning Watch--you remember? How everything\\nhe has to-day has come to him by the goodness of Christian people. At\\nfirst I thought that was no more than a description of his particular\\ncase, because I knew how true it was. But when you begin to trace things\\nback, as you say, what's true about Phil is true about all of\\nus--anyway, about me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How is that, son?\\\" Mrs. Farwell asked gently.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I mean,\\\" J.W. smilingly answered her, though flushing a little\\ntoo, \\\"the Institute, that seemed to me something new and different, is\\nreally tied up to what you folks and the whole church have been doing\\nfor me as far back as I can remember.\\\"\\n\\nAnd so they talked, parents and pastor and J.W., quite naturally and\\nfreely, of the long chain of interest which had linked his life to the\\nchurch's life, back through all the years to his babyhood.\\n\\nJ.W. had been in the League only a year or two, but it seemed to him\\nthat he had been in the church always. And the memories of his boyhood\\nwhich had the church for center, were intimately interwoven with all his\\nother experiences.\\n\\nAs his father said, \\\"I guess, pastor, if you tried to take out of J.W.'s\\nyoung life all that the church has meant to him, it would puzzle a\\nprofessor to explain whatever might be left.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. had been born in the country, on a farm whose every tree and fence\\ncorner he still loved. His first recollections of the church as part of\\nhis life had to do with the Sunday morning drive to the little\\nmeetinghouse, which stood where the road to town skirted a low hill. It\\nhad horse-sheds on one side, stretching back to the rear of the church\\nlot, and some sizeable elms and maples were grouped about its front and\\nsides. It was a one-room structure, unless you counted the space\\ncurtained off for the primary class, as J.W. always did. For back of\\nthis curtain's protecting folds he had begun his career as a Sunday\\nschool pupil and had made his first friends. At that time even district\\nschool was yet a year ahead of him, with its wider democratic joys and\\ngriefs, and its larger freedom from parental oversight.\\n\\nWhen J.W. was six, going on seven, the family moved to Delafield,\\nthough retaining ownership of the farm, and for years J.W. spent nearly\\nevery Saturday on the old place, in free and blissful association with\\nthe Shenk children, whose father was the tenant. It was here that he and\\nMartin Luther Shenk, already introduced as \\\"Marty,\\\" being of the same\\nage, had sworn eternal friendship, a vow which as yet showed no sign\\nwhatever of the ravages of time. There were three other children, Ben\\nand Alice and Jeannette. Now, Jeannette was only two years younger than\\nJ.W. and Marty, but through most of the years when J.W. was going every\\nweek to the farm, she was \\\"only a girl,\\\" and far behind the two chums by\\nall the exacting standards which to boys are more than law. But there\\ncame a time----\\n\\nJ.W., Sr., reveling in reminiscences before so patient a listener as the\\npreacher, though it was an old story, rehearsed how he had served for\\nyears as superintendent of the country Sunday school, and how Mrs.\\nFarwell was teacher of the Girls' Bible Class. Their home had always\\nbeen Methodist headquarters, he said, as old-time Methodists usually\\nsay, and with truth.\\n\\nWhen they moved to town the change brought no loss of church interest;\\nthe Farwells merely transferred it entire to Delafield First Church\\n(\\\"First\\\" being more a title than a numeral, since there was no second).\\n\\nBut First Church had not a few progressive saints. They wanted the best\\nthat could be had, so J.W., Sr., Sunday school enthusiast that he was,\\nfound himself in a new place of opportunity. The Board of Sunday Schools\\nat Chicago had been asked to help Delafield get itself in line with the\\nbest ideas and methods, and J.W., Sr., found the beginnings, at least,\\nof Sunday school science in active operation. At first, like a true\\ncountry man, he was a little inclined to counsels of caution, but in\\nhis country Sunday school work he had acquired such strong opinions\\nabout old fogies that he dreaded being thought one himself.\\n\\n\\\"And that's how it happened,\\\" he said with a laugh, \\\"that I was soon\\nreckoned among the progressives. In that first year I helped 'em win\\ntheir fight for separate departments, and before long we had the makings\\nof a real graded Sunday school. Don't you remember, mother, how proud\\nyou were when young J.W. there was graduated from the Primary into the\\nJunior Department?\\\"\\n\\nAll this was before Pastor Drury's time, of course, but he had gone\\nthrough the same experiences in other pastorates, and needed not to have\\nanything explained.\\n\\n\\\"How long have we had a teacher-training class in our Sunday school?\\\" he\\nasked.\\n\\nThat called out the story of the struggles to set up what many openly\\ncalled a useless and foolish enterprise. The Sunday school was\\nchronically short of teachers, and yet J.W., Sr., and the other\\nreformers insisted on taking out of the regular classes the best\\nteachers in the school, and a score of the most promising young people.\\nThis group went off by itself into a remote part of the church. It\\nfurnished no substitute teachers. It wasn't heard of at all. And loud\\nwere the complaints about its crippling the school.\\n\\n\\\"But, pastor, you should have seen the difference when the first dozen\\nreal teachers came out of that class; we were able to reorganize the\\nwhole school. Our John Wesley got a teacher he'll never forget. And, of\\ncourse, we kept the training class going; it's never stopped since. The\\nBoard of Sunday Schools has given us the courses and helped us keep the\\nclass up to grade in its work, and you know what sort of teachers we\\nhave now.\\\"\\n\\nThe pastor did, and was properly thankful. In some of his other\\npastorates it had been otherwise, to his sorrow.\\n\\n\\\"Speaking of the Board of Sunday Schools,\\\" the elder Farwell resumed,\\nfor this was a hobby he missed no chance to ride, \\\"it made all the\\ndifference with us in our work for a better Sunday school--gave us\\nexpert backing, you know. And I notice by its latest annual report--yes,\\nI always get a copy, though J.W. thinks it dry reading--that it is\\nhelping Sunday schools by the thousand, not in this country only, but\\nwherever in the world our church is at work. Of course you know how it\\nstarts Sunday schools, and how often they grow into churches. Well, it\\ndidn't quite do that here, but this church is a sight better and bigger\\nbecause we began to take the Board's advice when we did. It was a good\\nthing for our boy, and many another boy and girl, that the Board woke us\\nup.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It hasn't all been easy work, though,\\\" the minister suggested. \\\"I\\nremember that when I came I found there was a good deal of discontent\\nover the Graded Lessons.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sure there was,\\\" said J.W., Sr. \\\"We had all been brought up on the\\nUniform Lessons, and most of us thought they were just right. Besides,\\nwe rather enjoyed thinking of ourselves as keeping step with the whole\\nSunday school world--all over the wide earth everybody studying the same\\nscripture on the same Sunday. And that was a big idea to get into the\\nminds of Christians of every name everywhere.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, but, Dad,\\\" put in J.W., \\\"what was the good of it if the lessons\\ndidn't fit everybody? Did people think that the kids in the primary and\\ntheir mothers in ma's class ought to study the same lesson? or did they\\nthink they could fit the same lesson to everybody by the different notes\\nthey put into the Quarterlies?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, son,\\\" his father replied, \\\"I reckon we thought both ways. And I'm\\nnot so sure yet that it can't be done. But if one thing more than\\nanother reconciled me to the Graded Lessons, it was that they made being\\na Sunday school teacher a good deal bigger job than it had ever been. It\\nwas harder work, because every lesson had to be studied by the teacher,\\nand in a different way from what was thought good enough in the old\\ndays. And I'm for anything, Graded Lessons or whatever, that'll make\\npeople take Sunday school teaching more seriously.\\\"\\n\\nThen Mrs. Farwell ventured to take up the story. It was about that time,\\nin the very beginning of the Drury pastorate, that J.W. joined the\\nchurch on probation; much to her surprise and humbling.\\n\\n\\\"I hadn't even thought of it,\\\" she said, \\\"though I should have been the\\nfirst one. He had been getting ready in the Junior League, as I very\\nwell knew, but one day, as you may remember\\\"--Brother Drury did, for\\nthat day was the real beginning of this story--\\\"you made an invitation\\nat the end of a real simple sermon, and if J.W., Jr., didn't get right\\nup from my side and walk straight to the front!\\\"\\n\\nAfter that there had been a probationers' class, with J.W. and perhaps\\ntwenty others meeting the pastor every week for straight religious\\nteaching, so that at Easter, when they came up for membership, what with\\ntheir Sunday school and Junior League training, and what with the\\npastor's more personal instruction, they were able to pass a pretty fair\\nexamination on the great Christian truths, and on the general scheme of\\nthe church's work.\\n\\n\\\"For a time mother was a trifle disappointed that J.W. hadn't waited for\\nthe big revival we had the next year,\\\" said J.W., Sr., \\\"but I think she\\nwas glad afterward.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I was,\\\" the mother said. \\\"You see, I had been brought up to\\nbelieve in revivals, and I do yet, but we had no such chance to get the\\nright Christian start when we were little children, as J.W. has had, if\\nyou'll let his mother say so, and that made a revival a good deal more\\nimportant to us when our church did get ready for one. But the other way\\nis all right too. I'm mother enough to be glad J.W. hasn't known some of\\nthe experiences the boys of my time went through, and the girls as well.\\nHe's no worse a Christian for having been right in the church ever since\\nI put him in short dresses, are you, son? And I will say that his father\\nwas always with me in holding to the promises we made when he was\\nbaptized. We've not done what we might, but we've never forgotten that\\nthose promises were made to be kept.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. felt none of his old shrinking from such talk, especially since the\\nInstitute, and yet he had the healthy boy's reluctance to discuss\\nhimself in company. But this was interesting him, outside himself.\\n\\nHe turned to the pastor. \\\"That's what I meant when I told you what Phil\\nsaid. I'm all for the church, and church people and church ways; why\\nshouldn't I be? I've never known anything else. I remember well the one\\nthing I didn't like when it first came along; and that was the new sort\\nof Christmas celebration Dad and the others planned when I was ten or\\neleven. You know what Christmas means to such kids, and I guess we were\\nall selfish together, because we didn't use our heads. Well, the Sunday\\nschool proposed that instead of us all getting something we should all\\ngive something. It looked pretty cheap to us little fellows at first,\\nand our teacher had all he could do to hold us in line. But let me tell\\nyou, every boy was for it when the time came. We found that we could\\nhave as much fun giving things away as we could grabbing things, and,\\nanyway, nobody really cared for those mosquito net stockings filled with\\nnuts and candy and one orange. It was only the idea of getting something\\nfor nothing. That first 'giving Christmas,' I remember, our class\\ndressed up as delivery boys, and we came on the platform with enough\\ngroceries for a small truck load, that we had bought with our own money.\\nThe orphanage got 'em next day. And one class was dusty millers,\\ncarrying sacks of flour, and another put on a stunt of searching for\\nCaptain Kidd's treasure, and they found a keg of shining coins (new\\npennies, they were)--more than a thousand of 'em. Everything went to the\\norphanage, or the hospital; and then when the Board of Sunday Schools\\nbegan to get us interested in other Sunday schools and in missions--I\\nremember a scheme they call a 'Partnership Plan' that was great; I don't\\nknow what happened to it--I got right into the game every time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How do you happen to know so much about the Board of Sunday Schools,\\nJ.W.?\\\" asked Mr. Drury.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, that's easy. You know how it is in our Sunday school: they don't\\nmake one or two of us young fellows serve as librarians and secretaries\\nand such and miss all the class work: they have more help, and we all\\nget into class for the lesson. Well, two years ago Dad told me you had\\nnominated me for something at the annual Sunday school meeting. It was\\nonly a sort of assistant secretary's job, but very soon I began to catch\\non, and I've seen a lot of the letters and leaflets that come from the\\nBoard in Chicago. Well, let me tell you that Board of Sunday Schools is\\na whale of a machine. Why, it's the whole church at work to make better\\nSunday schools, and more of 'em. They have Sunday school workers in all\\nsorts of wild places, and Sunday school missionaries in foreign lands.\\nYes, and last year I happened to meet one of their secretaries, at your\\nhouse, you may remember. But you'd never think he was just a secretary,\\nhe was so keen and wide awake. He knew the Boy Scouts from A to Z, and\\nthat got me, 'cause I'm not so old that I've forgotten my scouting. And\\nhe knew baseball, and boys' books, and all that. Don't you think,\\nBrother Drury, if more of the fellows knew what the real Sunday school\\nwork is they would take to it like colts to a bran mash?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They couldn't help it,\\\" said the pastor. \\\"And you may have noticed that\\nyour father and the other people of our Sunday School Board are trying\\nto get them to find out some of the things you have found out. For\\ninstance, you know what the two organized classes of high-school\\nfreshmen are doing, and the other organized classes. Seems to me their\\nmembers are finding out that Sunday school is something big and fine.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That they are,\\\" Mrs. Farwell agreed, \\\"and you mustn't forget my\\nwonderful class of young married women, and the men's class of nearly a\\nhundred. I think our Sunday school has really begun to change the ideas\\nof a lot of people. Just think how little trouble we have now with what\\nGraded Lessons we have, and how happy all our teachers are because they\\nhave the helps they need for just the sort of pupils that are in their\\nclasses.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's so,\\\" said J.W., Sr. \\\"I don't suppose even old Brother Barnacle,\\n'sot' as he is, would vote to go back to the times when the\\nsuperintendent reviewed the lesson the same way the teachers taught it,\\nfrom a printed list of questions. Seems as if I can hear Henry J. Locke\\nyet--his farm joins ours down by the creek--when he conducted the\\nreviewing at Deep Creek. He would hold his quarterly at arm's length to\\nfavor his eyes, and then look up from it to the school and shoot the\\nquestion at everybody, 'And what did Peter do _then_, HEY?' He sure did\\ncome out strong on Peter; but I'll say this for him, that he never\\nskipped a question from start to finish.\\\"\\n\\nAll three laughed a little over Henry J. Locke, and then the pastor said\\nhe mustn't stay much longer. But he did want to back up J.W.'s belief\\nthat what Phil Khamis had said was true of everybody--we are all\\ndebtors.\\n\\n\\\"Look at this young J.W. here, will you,\\\" he said to the father and\\nmother, for once letting himself go, \\\"with a name he's proud of, and a\\nhome life that many a Fifth Avenue and Lake Shore Drive family would be\\nglad to pay a million for, if such goods were on sale in the stores. I'm\\ngoing to tell him something he already knows. Young man,\\\" and there was\\na gleam in the pastor's eye that was not all to the credit of the work\\nhe was praising, \\\"you owe a big debt to the Sunday school. I'm not\\njealous for the church, or for any other part of it, but by your own\\nadmission the Sunday school has had a lot to do with your education.\\nVery well; remember it is a part of what Phil said, and what you are\\nbecause of the Sunday school you have become by the goodness of\\nChristian people. I don't think you'll forget it, seeing that you have\\ntwo of that sort of people in your own home all the time.\\\"\\n\\nAnd then, with a fine naturalness the little group knelt by the chairs,\\nand two of the four, he who was pastor of the whole flock and he who\\nwith simple dignity was priest in his own household, gave thanks to God\\nfor the manifold goodness of Christian people, of which they were all\\npartakers every day.\\n\\nAs he went home, Walter Drury thought of the long days that stretched\\nout ahead before he could see the outcomes of the great Experiment, but\\nthis night had seen a good night's work done in the laboratory, and he\\nwas content.\\n\\nOne tale of the past had been much in J.W.'s thought that night, but\\nnothing on earth could have induced him to talk about it, especially\\nsince the happenings at the Institute. Only one other person knew all of\\nits inwardness, though the preacher guessed most of the secret pretty\\nshrewdly, and everybody was familiar with its outcome.\\n\\nIt was the story of Marty Shenk's conversion.\\n\\nThese two had been David and Jonathan from their little boy days, no\\nless friends because they were so unlike; Marty, a quiet, brooding,\\nknowledge-hungry youngster, and J.W. matter-of-fact, taking things as\\nthey came and asking few questions, but always the leader in games and\\nmischief; each the other's champion against all comers.\\n\\nMarty's father, tenant-farmer on the Farwell farm, was steady enough and\\ndependable, but never one to get ahead much. Before the Farwells moved\\nto town he had rarely stayed on the same farm more than a year or two,\\nbut, as he said, \\\"J.W. Farwell was different, and anybody who wanted to\\nbe decent could get along with him.\\\" So, for many Saturdays and\\nvacations of boyhood years J.W. and Marty had roamed the countryside,\\nand were letter-perfect in their boy-knowledge of the old farm.\\n\\nMarty came in to high school from the farm, and often he stayed with\\nJ.W. over the weekend. His school work was uneven--ahead in mathematics,\\nand the sciences, and something below the average in other studies.\\nThat, however, has no place in this story.\\n\\nOf course he and J.W. were thick as thieves. Except when class work made\\ntemporary separations necessary, they lived the high-school life\\ntogether. That meant also, for these two, the social life of the church,\\nwhich occasionally paid special attention to the students.\\n\\nSo you might find them at Epworth League socials, Sunday school class\\ndoings, in the Sunday school orchestra--violin and b-flat cornet\\nrespectively--and, most significant of all in its effect on all the\\nlater years, they went through Win-My-Chum week together. The hand of\\nthe pastor was in that, too.\\n\\nMarty was not a Christian. J.W. had been a church member for years, and\\nearly in his course he had faced and accepted all that being a Christian\\nseemed to mean to a high-school boy.\\n\\nThere had been hard places to get over; some of the boys and girls were\\nmerciless in their unconscious tests of his religion. Some were openly\\nscornful, and others sought by indirect and furtive means to break his\\ninfluence in the school. For he had no small gift of leadership, and he\\ncared a good deal that it should count for the decencies of high-school\\nlife. By senior year the sort of trouble that a Christian boy encounters\\nin school was almost all ended, but it had been more through his dogged\\nresistance to opposition than because of any special zest in Christian\\nservice.\\n\\nAnd then came the announcement of Win-My-Chum week, with J.W.\\nconfronted by two stubborn facts. He had only one real chum, and that\\nchum was not a Christian. Pastor Drury had let fall a remark, a month\\nbefore the Week, to the effect that any Christian who had a chum could\\ndodge Win-My-Chum week, but he couldn't dodge his chum. When the week\\nwas past, the chum would still be on hand.\\n\\nThink as he would, there was no honest way of escape from whatever those\\nfacts might require of him, so J.W., long accustomed to go ahead and\\ntake what came, had known himself bound by the obligations of this\\nmatter also, days and days before the activities of Win-My-Chum week\\nbegan.\\n\\nThe two were out one Saturday on the north road. They had been up to the\\nwoods on Barker's Hill for nuts, and with good success. The day was\\nwarm, the way was long, and there was no hurry. When they came to the\\nroadside at the wood's edge they sat on a fallen tree and talked. At\\nleast Marty did. For J.W. was not himself.\\n\\nIt was his chance, and he knew it. But a thousand impulses leaped to\\nlife within him to make him put off what he knew he ought to say. The\\nfear of being misunderstood--even by Marty--the knowledge that Marty, in\\nthe qualities by which boys judge and are judged, was quite as \\\"good\\\" as\\nhimself; and, above all, his sense of total unfitness to be a pattern of\\nthe Christian life to anybody, filled him with an uneasiness that\\nactually hurt.\\n\\nAnd Marty soon discovered that something was amiss. Willing as he was to\\ndo his full share of the talking, he became aware that except for\\ninarticulate commonplaces he was having to do it all.\\n\\n\\\"What's the matter with you all at once, J.W.?\\\" he asked. \\\"You're not\\ntaken suddenly sick, are you? You were all right when we were among the\\ntrees. _Are_ you sick?\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. laughed shortly. \\\"No, old man, I'm not sick. But I'm up against a\\nnew game, for me, and I'm not in training.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sounds interesting,\\\" said Marty, \\\"but sort of mysterious. Is it\\nanything I can do team-work on?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It surely is, but first I've got to say something, and I want you to\\npromise that you won't think I'm putting on, or butting in, because I'm\\nnot; nothing like it. Will you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Will I promise?\\\" said Marty, much bewildered. \\\"Course I'll promise not\\nto think anything about you that you don't want me to think, but I must\\nsay I don't know within a thousand miles what you're driving at. Out\\nwith it, and even if you're the train bandit who held up the Cannonball\\nor if you've plotted to kidnap the Board of Education, I'll never tell.\\\"\\n\\nMarty's quizzical humor was not making J.W.'s enterprise any easier. He\\nhad always supposed that what the leaflets called \\\"personal evangelism\\\"\\nhad to be done in a spirit of solemnity. But how was he to acquire the\\nproper frame of mind? And certainly there was nothing solemn about Marty\\njust now. Yet the thing had gone too far; it was too late to retreat. He\\ntried to think how Mr. Drury would do it, but saw only that if it was\\nMr. Dairy's business he would go straight to the center of it.\\nDesperately, therefore, he plunged in.\\n\\n\\\"Well, Marty,\\\" he said, speaking now with nervous haste, \\\"what I'm up\\nagainst is this. What's the matter with your being a Christian?\\\"\\n\\nHe will never forget the swift look of blank amazement that Marty turned\\non him, nor the slow-mounting flush that followed the first astonished\\nstart. For Marty did not answer, and turned his face away. J.W. was sure\\nthat in his blundering bluntness he had offended and probably angered\\nhis closest friend. The distress of that thought served at least to\\ndrive away all the self-consciousness which thus far had plagued him.\\n\\n\\\"Say, Marty,\\\" he pleaded, putting his hand on the other's arm, \\\"forget\\nit, if I've hurt your feelings. I know as well as you do that I'm not\\nfit to talk about such things to anybody, and, honest, I meant nothing\\nbut to say what I knew I'd got to say.\\\"\\n\\nThen Marty turned himself back slowly, and J.W. saw the troubled look\\nin his eyes. In a voice that trembled despite his proud effort at\\ncontrol, he said, \\\"Old man, you needn't apologize. You did surprise me,\\nI'll admit; I wasn't looking for anything like this. It's all right,\\nthough, and I'm certainly not mad about it. But, say, J.W., let me put\\nsomething up to you. Why did you never think to ask me that question\\nbefore?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, it was this way,\\\" J.W. began, somewhat puzzled at the form of the\\nquestion, and still thinking he must set himself right with Marty. \\\"You\\nknow the Epworth League is planning for those special meetings\\nsoon--'Win-My-Chum Week'--and I've been asked to lead one of the\\nmeetings. But you can see that I wouldn't be ready to lead a meeting\\nlike that unless I had put this thing of being a Christian up to you,\\nanyway. You're the only real chum I've got. Mr. Drury said something a\\nlittle while ago that made it mighty plain.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Marty, \\\"I can see that. But why did you never say anything\\nto me about it when there wasn't any meeting coming? Haven't we always\\nshared everything else, since away back? This is the one subject that\\nyou and I have kept away from in our talk of all we've ever thought\\nabout, and I was wondering why.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I don't exactly know,\\\" J.W. replied. \\\"It may have been that it\\nnever seemed to be any of my business; that it was the preacher's\\nbusiness, or the Sunday school teacher's, or somebody's. And you know\\nI've always been surer of what you really are than I have of myself. I\\nthink I was always afraid you would either make fun of me or believe I\\nwas letting on to be better than you were. But when the League got into\\nthis Win-My-Chum plan, why, the name itself was an eye-opener. And I've\\nseen lately that a fellow's got to be a Christian, out and out, or his\\nreligion is no good. And when I heard the preacher say, not long ago,\\nthat a fellow might dodge Win-My-Chum week, but he couldn't forever\\ndodge his chum, I knew I had to speak to you. But you're sure you're not\\noffended?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let me admit a thing to you, J.W. I've never said so before, but I've\\nbeen wanting somebody to ask me to be a Christian for a long time. I was\\na coward about it, and wouldn't let on. I've been wanting to find out\\nwhat I've got to do, but I wouldn't ask. Do you think I _could_ be a\\nChristian?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know you could be a long way better Christian than I am,\\\" J.W.\\nanswered with unwonted feeling. \\\"And if you did take Jesus Christ to be\\nyour Master, it would be more than just your getting religion. You would\\nbe the biggest kind of stand-by for me and for other people I know of.\\nIt's the one thing you need to be a hundred per cent right. I'm a pretty\\npoor Christian, myself, Marty, partly because I don't know how to think\\nmuch about it, but you'd be dead in earnest to get all that there is in\\nthe Christian life, and maybe I could follow along behind. You've always\\nhelped every other way, and I've always wanted you to help me be a\\ngenuine Christian.\\\"\\n\\nMarty put his hand on J.W.'s shoulder and looked him straight in the\\neye: \\\"You've got me rated a lot too high,\\\" he said. \\\"How can I help you?\\nBut we two have been pretty good chums so far, haven't we? Well, there's\\na lot to settle before I can be sure I'm a Christian, but it means\\neverything for you to think I can be of some use. And I promise you\\nthis, J.W., I'll not let up until I am a Christian, and we'll stick\\ntogether all the more, when I am, us two. Is that ago?\\\"\\n\\nIt was a go. J.W. was ready and far more than ready to call it a go. It\\nhad been easier than he had expected, but then it had all been so\\ndifferent from the vague and formal thing he had been afraid of. He\\ncould hardly believe, but he had one request to make. \\\"I know you'll\\nsettle whatever has to be settled,\\\" he said, a bit unsteadily, \\\"but when\\nit's all done, and you tell people about it, as I know you will, please,\\nMarty, don't bring me into it. Publicly, I mean. Let's just have this\\nunderstanding between ourselves. I can lead my meeting now, but there's\\nno need to say anything about me. Besides, I made a mess of it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It may be the best mess anybody ever stirred up for me, J.W., but I\\nwon't say anything to worry you, if the time comes for me to say\\nanything at all. And I believe it will.\\\"\\n\\nIt did. Marty and the pastor had two or three long interviews. From the\\nlast of them the boy came away with a new light on his face and a new\\nspring in his step. Evidently whatever needed to be settled, had been\\nsettled.\\n\\nHe kept his promise to his chum, but that did not prevent him from\\nchoosing the night when J.W. led the meeting to stand up at the first\\nopportunity and make his straightforward confession of love and loyalty,\\nsince God had made him a sharer in the life that is in Christ. Then for\\na moment J.W. feared Marty might forget their agreement, but Marty said\\nsimply, \\\"And part of the joy that is in my heart to-night is because\\nthere is a new tie, the only other one we needed, between myself and my\\nold-time chum, the leader of this meeting.\\\"\\n\\nIn the back of the room Walter Drury, quietly looking on, sent up a\\nsilent thanksgiving. The great Experiment was going well.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nCAMPUS DAYS\\n\\nSo it was that J.W. and Marty had come into the inner places of each\\nother's lives. Of all the developments of Institute week, naturally the\\none which filled J.W.'s thoughts with a sort of awed gladness was\\nMarty's decision to offer himself for the ministry. Joe Carbrook's\\nright-about-face was much more dramatic, for J.W. saw, when the decision\\nwas made, that Marty could not have been meant for anything but a\\npreacher. It was as fit as you please. As to Joe, previous opinion had\\nbeen pretty equally divided; one side leaning to the idea that he might\\nmake a lawyer, and the other predicting that he was more likely to be a\\nperpetual and profitable client for some other lawyer.\\n\\nIn the light of the Institute happenings, it was to be expected that the\\nquestion of college would promptly become a practical matter to four\\nDelafield people. Marty was greatly troubled, for he knew if he was to\\nbe a preacher, he must go to college, and he couldn't see how. J.W. felt\\nno great urge, though it had always been understood that he would go.\\nMarcia Dayne had one year of normal school to her credit, and would take\\nanother next year, perhaps; but this year she must teach.\\n\\nJoe Carbrook spent little time in debate with himself; he let everybody\\nknow that he was going to be a missionary doctor, and that he would go\\nto the State University for the rest of his college course.\\n\\n\\\"But what about the religious influence of the University?\\\" Marcia Dayne\\nhad ventured to ask him one evening as they walked slowly under the elms\\nof Monroe Avenue.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know about that,\\\" Joe answered, \\\"and maybe I'm making a\\nmistake. But I don't think so. To begin with, there isn't any question\\nabout equipment at the State University. They have everything any church\\nschool has, and probably more than most church schools, for what I want.\\nAnd they work in close relationship to the medical school. That's one\\nthing. The big reason, though--I wonder if you'll understand it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I believe I could understand anything you might be thinking about--now,\\nJoe.\\\" And Marcia's voice had in it a note which stirred that usually\\nself-possessed young man out of all his easy composure.\\n\\n\\\"I'll remember that, Marcia,\\\" he said in the thrill of a swift elation.\\n\\\"I'll remember that, because I think you do--understand, and some day\\nI--but I've got at least five years of plugging ahead of me, and----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You were going to tell me about your big reason for going to the State\\nUniversity,\\\" Marcia broke in, though she wondered afterward if her\\ninstinct had not played her false.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" Joe said, with a little effort. \\\"Well, this is it. You know I\\ndidn't make much of a hit at college; I pulled through sophomore year,\\nbut that's about all, and I doubt if the faculty will pass resolutions\\nof regret when I don't show up there in the fall. The religious\\ninfluences of a church school didn't prevent me from being a good deal\\nof a heathen, though I will say that was no fault of the school. Maybe I\\nought to go back and face the music. It wouldn't be so bad, I guess. But\\nI feel more like making a clean, new start, in a new place. The State\\nUniversity wouldn't be any worse for me than I should be for it, if\\nnothing had happened to change my point of view. So, that isn't the\\nissue. But if the State University life is able to beat me before I get\\nto sawing bones at all, I'd make a pretty missionary doctor if I ever\\nlanded in foreign parts, wouldn't I?\\\"\\n\\nMarcia could find nothing to say; perhaps because her thoughts were busy\\nwith other and more personal aspects of Joe's plans for the future.\\n\\nAnd as Joe's people were completely oblivious to everything except the\\nstartling change that had come over him, and were abundantly able to\\nsend him to three universities at once if necessary, Joe Carbrook was as\\ngood as enrolled.\\n\\nMarty and J.W. did not find the future opening up before them so easily.\\nMarty, for all he could not imagine the way opening before such as\\nhimself, was all eagerness about the nearest Methodist school, which\\nhappened to be the one where the Institute had been held, Cartwright\\nCollege. It was named, as may be supposed, in honor of Peter Cartwright,\\nthat pioneer Methodist preacher who became famous on the same sort of\\nschooling which sufficed for Abraham Lincoln, and once ran against\\nLincoln himself for Congress. J.W. was not specially eager to look for a\\ncollege education anywhere. Why should he be, since he was expecting to\\ngo into business?\\n\\nThe two had many a discussion, Marty arguing in favor of college for\\neverybody, and J.W. admitting that for preachers and teachers and\\nlawyers and doctors it was necessary, but what use could it be in\\nbusiness?\\n\\n\\\"But say, J.W., you're not going to be one of these 'born a man, died a\\ngrocer' sort of business men,\\\" urged Marty. \\\"Broad-minded--that's your\\nfuture, with a knowledge of more than markets. And look at the personal\\nside of college life. Haven't you heard Mr. Drury say that if he hadn't\\nanything else to show for his four years at college than the lifelong\\nfriendships he made there it would have been worth all it cost? And you\\nhave reason to know he doesn't forget the studies.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's all right, Marty,\\\" J.W. rejoined. \\\"I don't need much convincing\\non that score. I can see the good times too; you know I'd try for all\\nthe athletics I could get into, and I guess I could keep my end up\\nsocially. But is all that worth my time for the next four years,\\nstudying subjects that would be no earthly good to me in business, in\\nmaking a living, I mean? The other boys in hardware stores would have\\nfour years the start of me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But don't you remember, J.W., what our commencement speaker said on\\nthat very point? He told us we had to be men and women first, no matter\\nwhat occupations we got into. And he bore down hard on how it was a good\\ndeal bigger business to make a life than to make a living. In these days\\nthe most dangerous people, to themselves and to all of us, are the\\nuneducated people.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I remember,\\\" J.W. admitted. \\\"'Cultural and social values of\\neducation,' he called that, didn't he? And that's what I'm not sure of.\\nIt seems pretty foggy to me. But, old man, you're going, that's settled,\\nand maybe I'll just let dad send me to keep you company, if I can't find\\nany better reason.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's all very well for you to say, J.W.,\\\" Marty retorted, with the\\nleast little touch of resentment in his tone. \\\"You'll _let_ your dad\\nsend you. My dad can't send me, though he'll do all he's able to do, and\\nhow I can earn enough, to get through is more than I can see from here.\\\"\\n\\nBut J.W. asserted, confidently: \\\"There's a way, just the same, and I\\nthink I know how to find out about it. I haven't been a second assistant\\ndeputy secretary in the Sunday school for nothing. You reminded me of\\nthe commencement address; I'll ask you if you remember Children's Day?\\nIt came the very next Sunday.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I remember it; but what of it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, my boy, we took up a collection for you!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We did? Not much we did, and anyway, do you think I'd accept that sort\\nof help? I'm not looking for charity, yet,\\\" and Marty showed the hurt he\\nfelt.\\n\\n\\\"Steady, Martin Luther! I wouldn't want you to get that collection\\nanyway; it wasn't near big enough. But don't you know that every\\nChildren's Day collection in the whole church goes to the Board of\\nEducation, and that it has become a big fund, never to be given away but\\nalways to be loaned to students getting ready to be preachers and such?\\nIt's no charity; it's the same broad-minded business you want me to go\\nto college for. I can see that much without getting any nearer to\\ncollege than the Delafield First Church Sunday School. You borrow the\\nmoney, just as if you stepped up to a bank window, and you agree to pay\\nit back as soon as you can after you graduate. Then it goes into the\\nFund again, and some other boy or girl borrows it, and so on. More than\\ntwenty-five thousand students have borrowed from this fund. About\\nfifteen hundred of 'em got loans last year. Ask the preacher if I'm not\\ngiving you this straight.\\\"\\n\\nMarty had no immediate way of testing this unusual wealth of\\ninformation, so he said, \\\"Well, maybe there's something in it. I'll talk\\nto Brother Drury about it, anyway.\\\"\\n\\nThat observing man was quite willing to be talked to. When Marty\\npresented himself at the study a few days later he found the pastor as\\nwell prepared as if he had been expecting some such interview, as,\\nindeed, he had.\\n\\nHe told Marty the story of the Student Loan Fund--how it originated in\\nthe celebration of the Centenary of American Methodism, in 1866, and how\\nit had been growing all through the years, both by the annual Children's\\nDay offering and by the increasing return of loans from former students.\\n\\nThen he explained that this Fund, and many other educational affairs,\\nwere in the hands of the Church's Board of Education. This Board, Marty\\nheard, is a sort of educational clearing house for the whole church, and\\nespecially for Methodist schools of higher learning. It helps young\\npeople to go to college, and it helps the colleges to take care of the\\nyoung people when they go, of course always using money which has come\\nfrom the churches. It has charge of a group of special schools in the\\nSouth, and it sets the scholastic standards to which all the church's\\nschools and colleges must conform. Besides looking out for these\\ninterests it helps the school to provide courses in the Bible and\\nChristian principles, and it furnishes workers to serve the colleges in\\ncaring for the religious life of the students.\\n\\nMarty listened carefully, and with no lack of interest, but when the\\nminister paused the boy's mind sprang back to his own particular\\nconcern.\\n\\n\\\"But, Mr. Drury, can any student borrow money from that fund?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, no,\\\" said the preacher, \\\"not every student. Only those who are\\npreparing for the ministry or for other careers of special service. They\\nhave to show that the loan will help them in preparing to be of some\\ndefinite Christian value when they graduate. That won't affect you; you\\ncan borrow, not all you could use, perhaps, but enough to be a big help.\\nHow much do you expect to need?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why,\\\" answered Marty, \\\"I hardly know. I hadn't really thought it\\npossible I could go. But dad says he'll let me have all he can, and they\\ntell me a fellow can get work to do if he's not particular about easy\\njobs. I'm pretty sure I could manage, except for tuition and books,\\nbut----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then you may as well consider it settled,\\\" said the pastor, \\\"Cartwright\\nCollege will welcome you on those terms, or I'll know the reason why.\\nAnd I think you can count on J.W. going with you.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. was not hard to convince. His parents were all for it. The pastor\\nhad no intention of overdoing his own part in the affair, and contented\\nhimself with a suggestion that disposed of J.W.'s main objection.\\n\\nJ.W. had been saying to him one day, \\\"I know I should have a good time\\nat college, but I should be four years later getting into business than\\nthe other boys.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That depends on what 'later' means,\\\" replied Mr. Drury. \\\"You would not\\nneed four years to catch up, if college does for you what I think it\\nwill. Besides, you're intending to be a Christian citizen, I take it,\\nand that will be even more of a job than to be a successful hardware\\nman. Colleges have been operating these many years, to give young people\\nthe best possible preparations for a whole life. Remember what John\\nMilton said: I care not how late I come, so I come fit.' You want to\\ncome to your work as fit as they make 'em, don't you?\\\"\\n\\nAnd J.W. owned up that he did. \\\"I don't mean to be a dub in business,\\nand I've no right to be a dub anywhere. Me for Cartwright, Brother\\nDrury!\\\"\\n\\nAnother day's work in the laboratory. Walter Drury knew how to be\\npatient, yet every experience like this was a tonic to his soul. And now\\nhe must be content for a time to let others carry the work through its\\nnext stages, though he would hold himself ready for any unexpected\\ndevelopment that might arise.\\n\\nSo it befell that J.W. and Marty started to Cartwright, and a week later\\nJoe Carbrook went off to the State University.\\n\\nThe day after they had matriculated, J.W. and Marty were putting their\\nroom to rights--oh, yes, they thought it would be well to share the same\\nroom--and as they puttered about they reviewed the happenings of the\\nfirst day. They had made a preliminary exploration of the grounds and\\nbuildings, revisiting the places which had become familiar during\\nInstitute week, and living over that crowded and epochal time.\\n\\nMarty, scouting around for something to do, had discovered that he could\\nget work, such as it was, for ten hours a week, anyway, and maybe more,\\nat thirty to fifty cents an hour. He had a little money left after\\npaying his tuition, and the college registrar assured him that the loan\\nfrom the Board of Education would be forthcoming. Therefore the talk\\nturned on money.\\n\\n\\\"That tuition bill sure reduced the swelling in my pocketbook, Marty,\\\"\\nremarked J.W., as he examined his visible resources.\\n\\n\\\"What do you think it did to mine?\\\" Marty observed quietly. \\\"I'm still\\ngiddy from being relieved of so much money in one operation. And yet I\\ncan't see how they get along. Look at the big faculty they have, and all\\nthese buildings to keep up and keep going. When I think of how big a\\ndollar seems to me, the tuition looks like the national debt of Mexico;\\nbut when I try to figure out how much it costs the college per student,\\nI feel as though I were paying lunch-counter prices for a dining-car\\ndinner. How _do_ they do it, J.W.?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who told you I was to be looked on in the light of a World Almanac, my\\nson? I could give you the answer to that question without getting out of\\nmy chair, but for one small difficulty--I just don't know. Tell you\\nwhat--it's a good question--let's look in the catalogue. I'd like to\\nfind information in that volume about something besides the four\\ncenturies of study that loom before my freshman eyes.\\\"\\n\\nSo they looked in the catalogue and discovered that Cartwright College\\nhad an endowment of $1,750,000, producing an income of about $80,000 a\\nyear, and that the churches of its territory gave about $25,000 more.\\nThey learned also that most of the buildings had been provided by\\nfriends of the college, with the Carnegie Library mainly the gift of the\\nmillionaire ironmaster. They learned also that about $500,000 of the\\nendowment had been raised in the last two years, under the promise of\\nthe General Education Board, which is a Rockefeller creation, to provide\\nthe last $125,000. The college property was valued at about half a\\nmillion dollars.\\n\\n\\\"And there you are, Martin Luther, my bold reformer,\\\" said J.W.,\\ncheerfully. \\\"The people who put up the money have invested about two and\\na half millions on you and me, and the other five hundred students, say\\nabout $250 a year per student. And we pay the rest of what it costs to\\ngive us a college career, $125 to $175 a year, depending on our taste in\\ncourses. I remember I felt as if the John Wesley Farwell family had\\nalmost gone broke when dad signed up for $1,000 on that last endowment\\ncampaign. I thought the money gone forever, but I see now he merely\\ninvested it. I've come to Cartwright to spend the income of it, and a\\nlittle more. Five or six people have given a thousand dollars apiece to\\nmake a college course possible for each of us. There's some reason in\\ncollege endowments, after all.\\\"\\n\\nAnd Marty said, \\\"One good I can see in this particular endowment is that\\nanybody but a selfish idiot would be glad to match four years of his\\nlife against all the money and work that Christian people have put into\\nCartwright College.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hope you don't mean anything personal by that remark,\\\" J.W. said,\\nwith mock solemnity, \\\"because I'm inclined to believe you're more than\\nhalf right. It reminds me again of what Phil Khamis said. I'm beginning\\nto think I'll never have a chance to forget that Greek's Christian\\nremark about Christians.\\\"\\n\\nBy being off at school together J.W. and Marty gave each other\\nunconfessed but very real moral support in those first days when a lone\\nfreshman would have known he was homesick.\\n\\nBut another antidote, both pleasant and potent, was supplied by the\\nEpworth League of First Church. It had allied itself with the college\\nY.M.C.A.--and for the women students, with the Y.W.C.A.--in various\\nways, but particularly it purposed to see that the first few Sundays\\nwere safely tided over.\\n\\nSo the two chums found themselves in one of the two highly attractive\\nstudy courses which had been put on in partnership with the Sunday\\nschool. It was in the early afternoon of one of the early Sundays that\\nJ.W. called Marty's attention to a still more alluring opportunity.\\n\\n\\\"Looky here, Marty, it's raining, I know, but I've a feeling that you'd\\nbetter not write that letter home until a little further on in the day.\\nWhat's to stop us from taking a look at this League fellowship hour\\nwe're invited to, and getting a light lunch? We don't need to stay to\\nthe League meeting unless we choose, though we're members, you know.\\\"\\n\\nMarty picked up the card of invitation which J.W. had flipped across the\\ntable to him, and read it.\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" he commented, \\\"it reads all right. Let's try it.\\\"\\n\\nOut into the rain they went and put in two highly cheerful hours,\\nincluding one in the devotional meeting, so that when Marty at last sat\\ndown to write home, he produced, without quite knowing how, a letter\\nthat was vastly more heartening when it reached the farm than it would\\nhave been if he had written it before dark.\\n\\nJoe Carbrook set out for the State University in what was for him a\\nfashion quite subdued. Before his experience at the Institute he would\\nhave gone, if at all, in his own car, and his arrival would have been\\nnotice to \\\"the sporty crowd\\\" that another candidate for initiation into\\nthat select circle had arrived.\\n\\nBut Joe was enjoying the novelty of thinking a little before he acted.\\nThough he would always be of the irrepressible sort, he was not the same\\nJoe. He had laid out a program which surprised himself somewhat, and\\nastonished most of the people who knew him.\\n\\nHe knew now that he would become, if he could, a doctor; a missionary\\ndoctor. No other career entered his mind. He would finish his college\\nwork at the State University, and then go to medical school. He would\\ndevote himself without ceasing to all the studies he would need. Not for\\nhim any social life, any relaxation of purpose. Grimly he told himself\\nthat his play days were over. They had been lively while they lasted;\\nbut they were done.\\n\\nOf course that was foolish. If he had persisted in any such scholastic\\nregimen, the effort would have lasted a few days, or possibly weeks; and\\nthen in a reaction of disgust he might easily have come to despair of\\nthe whole project.\\n\\nFortunately for Joe and for a good many other people, his purpose of\\ndigging into his books and laboratory work and doggedly avoiding any\\nother interest was tempered by the happenings of the first week.\\nDoubtless he would have made a desperate struggle, but it would have\\nbeen useless. Not even conversion can make new habits overnight, and in\\nhis first two years at college Joe had been known to teachers and\\nstudents alike as distinctly a sketchy student, wholly inexpert at\\nconcentrated effort.\\n\\nAnd so, instead of becoming first a grind and then a discouraged rebel\\nagainst it all, he had the immense good fortune to be captured by an\\nobservant Junior whom he had met while they were both registering for\\nChemistry III.\\n\\n\\\"You're new here,\\\" said the Junior, Heatherby by name, \\\"and I've had two\\nyears of it. Maybe you'll let me show you the place. I'm the proud\\nhalf-owner of a decidedly second-hand 'Hooting Nanny,' you know, and I\\nrather like bumping people around town in it.\\\"\\n\\nThat was the beginning of many things. Joe liked it that Heatherby made\\nno apologies for his car, and before long he discovered that the other\\nhalf-owner, Barnard, was equally unaffected and friendly. It was\\nsomething of a surprise, though, to learn that Barnard was not a\\nstudent, but the youthful-looking pastor of the University Methodist\\nChurch, of late known as the Wesley Foundation.\\n\\n\\\"I'm not up on Methodism as I should be,\\\" said Joe to Barnard, a day or\\ntwo later, \\\"and I may as well admit that I never heard before of this\\nWesley Foundation of yours. Is it a church affair?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, rather,\\\" Barnard answered. \\\"It is just exactly that. You know, or\\ncould have guessed, that a good many of the students here are from\\nMethodist homes--about a fourth of the whole student body, as it\\nhappens. And our church has been coming to see, perhaps a bit slowly,\\nthat although the State could not provide any religious influences, and\\ncould certainly do nothing for denominational interests, there was all\\nthe more reason for the church to do it. That's the idea under the\\nFoundation, so to speak, and the work is now established in nine of the\\ngreat State Universities.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I see,\\\" Joe mused, \\\"but just what is the Foundation's duty, and\\nhow do you do it?\\\"\\n\\nBarnard laughed as he said, \\\"We do pretty near everything, in this\\nUniversity. We have a regular Methodist church, with a membership made\\nup almost entirely of faculty and students. The town people have their\\nown First Church, over on the West Side. Our church has its Sunday\\nschool, its Epworth League Chapter, and other activities. We try to come\\nout strong on the social side, and in a little while, when our Social\\nCenter building is up--we're after the money for it now--we can do a\\ngood deal more. There is plenty of demand for it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's all church work, of course. I suppose you have no relation to\\nthe University, though,\\\" Joe asked, \\\"studies and all that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, indeed, and we're coming to more of it, but gradually. We are\\nalready offering courses in religious subjects, with teachers recognized\\nby the University, and credit given. It's all very new yet, you know,\\nbut we're hoping and going ahead.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should think so,\\\" said Joe with emphasis. \\\"But where does the money\\ncome from for all this? It must be Methodist money, of course; who puts\\nit up?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, the usual people,\\\" said Barnard. \\\"A few well-to-do Methodists have\\nprovided some of it, but the really big money has to come from the\\nchurches--collections and subscriptions and all that. This sort of work\\nis being done in forty-odd other schools, where the Wesley Foundation is\\nnot organized. The money comes officially through two of the benevolent\\nboards.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes?\\\" queried Joe. \\\"I've often heard of 'the benevolences,' but I never\\nthought of them as meaning anything to me. How do they hook up to a\\nproposition like that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Barnard, \\\"the Board of Education, naturally, is interested\\nbecause of the Methodist students who are here. And the Board of Home\\nMissions and Church Extension is interested because at bottom this is\\nthe realest sort of home mission and church extension work.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do these boards supply all the money you need?\\\" was Joe's next\\nquestion.\\n\\n\\\"No, not all at once, anyway,\\\" Barnard answered. \\\"We're needing a good\\ndeal more before this thing really gets on its feet; and when our people\\nknow what work can be done in State schools, and what a glorious chance\\nwe have, I think they'll see that the money is provided. The students\\nare there, half a hundred thousand of them, and the church must be there\\ntoo.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" Joe said, \\\"I admire the faith of you. And I want to join. You\\nknow, although I'm a mighty green hand at religious work, I've got to go\\nat it hard. There's a reason. So please count me in on everything where\\nI'm likely to fit at all. I didn't tell you, did I, that I'm headed for\\nmedicine?--going to be a missionary doctor, if they'll take me when I'm\\nready. Maybe your Foundation can do something with me.\\\"\\n\\nBarnard thought it could, and the next two years justified his\\nconfidence. Joe Carbrook, as downright in his new purpose as he had been\\nin his old scornful refusal to look at life seriously, quickly found a\\nplace for himself in the church and the other activities of the\\nFoundation. It saved him from his first heedless resolution to study an\\nimpossible number of hours a day, and from the certain crash which would\\nhave followed. It gave him not a few friends, and he was soon deep in\\nthe affairs of the League and the church. Besides, it made possible some\\nspecial friendships among the faculty, which were to be of immense value\\nin later days.\\n\\nWhile Joe Carbrook was fitting himself into the life of the University\\nand the Wesley Foundation, the chums at Cartwright were quite as busy\\nmaking themselves a part of their new world. As always, they made a\\ngood team, so much so that people began to think of them not as\\nindividuals, but as necessarily related, like a pair of shoes, or collar\\nand tie, or pork and beans. And, though the old differences of\\ntemperament and interest had not lessened, the two had reached a fine\\ncontentment over each other's purposes. J.W. was happy in Marty's\\npreacher-plans, and Marty believed implicitly in the wisdom of J.W.'s\\nunderstood purpose to be a forthright Christian layman.\\n\\nBut it was not all plain sailing for J.W. Nobody bothered Marty; he was\\ngoing into the ministry, and that settled that. Among the students who\\nwent in for religious work were several who could not quite share\\nMarty's complacence over J.W.'s program. They thought it strange that so\\nactive a Christian, with the right stuff in him, as everybody\\nrecognized, should not declare himself for some religious vocation.\\n\\nAnd from time to time men came to college--bishops, secretaries,\\nspecialists--to talk to the students about this very thing. There was a\\nstudent volunteer band, in which were enrolled all the students looking\\nto foreign mission work. The prospective preachers had a club of their\\nown, and there was even a little organized group of boys and girls who\\nthought seriously of social service in some form or another as a career.\\n\\nNow, J.W., before the end of sophomore year, had come to know all, or\\nnearly all, of these young enthusiasts. Some of them developed into\\nstaunch and satisfying friends. If he had run with the sport crowd,\\nwhich was always looking for recruits, or if he had been merely a hard\\nstudent, working for Phi Beta Kappa, he might have been let alone. But,\\nwithout being able to wear an identifying label, he yet belonged with\\nthose who had come to college with a definite life purpose.\\n\\nJust because nobody seemed to realize that being a Christian in business\\ncould be as distinct a vocation as any, J.W. was at times vaguely\\ntroubled, in spite of his confident stand at the Institute. He wondered\\na little at what he had almost come to feel was his callousness. Not\\nthat he was uninterested; for Marty he had vast unspoken ambitions which\\nwould have stunned that unsuspecting youth if they had ever become\\nvocal; and he never tired of the prospects which opened up before his\\nother friends. He kept up an intermittent correspondence with Joe\\nCarbrook, and found himself thinking much about the strange chain of\\ncircumstances which promised to make a medical missionary out of Joe. He\\nmore than suspected that Joe and Marcia Dayne were vastly interested in\\neach other's future, and he got a lot of satisfaction out of that. They\\nwould have a great missionary career.\\n\\nNo; he was not unfeeling about all these high purposes of the boys and\\ngirls he knew; and if he could just get a final answer to the one\\nquestion that was bothering him, his college life would need nothing to\\nmake it wholly satisfying. He had early forgotten all his old reluctance\\nto put college before business.\\n\\nMarty knew something of what was passing in J.W.'s mind, and it\\ntroubled him a little. He thought of tackling J.W. himself, and by this\\ntime there was nothing under the sun they could not discuss with each\\nother freely. But he did not quite trust himself.\\n\\nAt last he made up his mind to write to their pastor at home. He knew\\nthat for some reason Mr. Drury had a peculiar interest in J.W. and was\\nsure he could count on it now.\\n\\n\\\"I know J.W.'s bothered,\\\" he wrote, \\\"but he doesn't talk about it. I\\nthink he has been disturbed by hearing so much about special calls to\\nspecial work. We've had several lifework meetings lately, and the needs\\nof the world have been pretty strongly stated. But the stand he took at\\nthe Institute is just as right for him as mine is for me. Can't you\\nwrite to him, or something?\\\"\\n\\nWalter Drury could do better than write. He turned up at Cartwright that\\nsame week.\\n\\nIt happened that three or four prospective preachers and Christian\\nworkers had been in their room that afternoon, and J.W. was trying to\\nthink the thing through once more. He recalled what his pastor had said\\nat the camp fire, and his own testimony on Institute Sunday in the\\nlife-service meeting, after Marcia Dayne had put it up to him. But he\\nwas making heavy weather of it. And just then came the pastor's knock at\\nthe door.\\n\\nThere was a boisterous welcome from them both, with something like\\nrelief in J.W.'s heart, that he would not, could not speak. But he could\\nget help now. For the sake of saying something he asked the usual\\nquestion. \\\"What in the world brings you to Cartwright?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" said Pastor Drury, \\\"I like to come to Cartwright. Your President's\\nan old friend. Besides, why shouldn't I come to see you two, if I wish?\\nYou are still part of my flock, you know.\\\"\\n\\nSo they talked of anything and everything. By and by Marty said he must\\ngo over to the library, and pretty soon J.W. was telling his friend the\\npastor all that had been disturbing him.\\n\\n\\\"It all began in the summer before I came to college, at the Institute\\nhere, you know, when you spoke at the camp fire on Saturday night.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I remember,\\\" the pastor replied. \\\"You hadn't taken much interest in\\nyour future work before that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No real interest, I guess,\\\" J.W. admitted. \\\"I'd always taken things as\\nthey came, and didn't go looking for what I couldn't see. I was enjoying\\nevery day's living, and didn't care deeply about anything else. Why,\\nthough I've been a Methodist all my life, you remember how I knew\\nnothing at all about the Methodist Church outside of Delafield, except\\nwhat little I picked up about its Sunday schools by serving as an\\nassistant to our Sunday school secretary. And when I began to hear, at\\nthe Institute, about home missions and foreign missions, about Negro\\neducation and other business that the church was doing, I saw right off\\nthat it was up to us young people to supply the new workers that were\\nalways needed. But, even so, only those who had a real fitness for it\\nought to offer themselves, and I thought too that something else would\\nbe needed. I wasn't any duller than lots of other church members--even\\nthe older ones didn't seem to know much more about the church outside\\nthan I did. You would take up collections for the benevolences, but if\\nyou told us what they meant, we didn't pay enough attention to get the\\nidea clearly, so as to have any real understanding. I suppose the\\nwomen's societies had more. I know my mother talks about Industrial\\nHomes in the South, and schools in India--she's in both the societies,\\nyou know--but that is about all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And it seemed when I began to find out about things, Mr. Drury, that if\\nour whole church needed workers for all these places, it needed just as\\nmuch to have in the local churches men and women who would know about\\nthe work in a big way, and who would care in a big way, to back up the\\nwhole work as it should be backed up. So, when you spoke at the camp\\nfire it was just what I wanted to hear, and when I was called on, I made\\nthat sort of a declaration the next day at the life decision services.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes I remember that too,\\\" said Mr. Drury, \\\"and I remember telling Joe\\nCarbrook that you had undertaken as big a career as any of them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's what I kind of thought too,\\\" said J.W., simply, \\\"but rooming\\nwith Marty Shenk--he's going to make a great preacher too--keeps me\\nthinking, and I know about all the students who are getting ready for\\nspecial work, and lately I've been wondering----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"About some special sort of work you'd like to do?\\\" Mr. Drury prompted.\\n\\n\\\"No; not that at all. I'm just as sure as ever I'm not that sort. If\\nonly I can make good in business, there's where I belong. But can a\\nfellow make good just as a Christian in the same way I expect Marty\\nShenk to make good as a Christian preacher?\\\"\\n\\nThe pastor stood up and came over to J.W.'s chair. \\\"My boy, I know just\\nwhat you are facing. It is a pretty old struggle, and there's only one\\nway out of it. God hasn't any first place and second place for the\\npeople that let him guide them. A man may refuse his call, either to go\\nor to stay, and then no matter what he does it will be a second best.\\nBut you--wait for your call. For my part, I think probably you've got\\nit, and it's to a very real life. If you and those like you should fail,\\nwe should soon have no more missionaries. And if the missionaries should\\nfail, we should soon have no more church. God has little patience with a\\nchurch that always stays at home, and I doubt if he has more for a\\nchurch that doesn't stand by the men and women it has sent to the\\noutposts. It is all one job.\\\"\\n\\nThere was much more of the same sort, and when J.W. walked with his\\npastor to the train the next morning, the only doubt that had ever\\nreally disturbed him in college was quieted for good.\\n\\nWalter Drury went back to Delafield and his work, surer now than ever\\nthat the Experiment was going forward. He knew, certainly, that all this\\nwas only the getting ready; that the real tests would come later But he\\nwas well content.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nIt was early football season of the junior year. The State University\\ntook on Cartwright College for the first Saturday's game, everybody well\\nknowing that it was only a practice romp for the University. Always a\\nbig time for Cartwright, this year it was a day for remembering. Joe\\nCarbrook, who had been graduated from the University in June, and was\\nnow a medical student in the city, drove down to see the game. For\\nloyalty's sake he joined the little bunch of University rooters on the\\neast stand. Otherwise it was Cartwright's crowd, as well as Cartwright's\\nday.\\n\\nTo the surprise of everybody, neither side scored until the last\\nquarter, and then both sides made a touchdown, Cartwright first! A high\\ntricky wind spoiled both attempts to kick goal, and time was called with\\na score at 6-6. Cartwright had held State to a tie, for the first time\\nin history!\\n\\nJoe came from the game with the chums and took supper with them. The\\nwhole town was ablaze with excitement over its team's great showing\\nagainst the State, and the talk at table was all of the way Cartwright's\\neleven could now go romping down the schedule and take every other\\ncollege into camp, including, of course, Barton Poly, their dearest foe.\\n\\nThe boys were happy to have Joe with them, he looked so big and fine,\\nand had the same easy, breezy bearing as of old. Nor had he lost any of\\nthat frank attitude toward his own career which never failed to\\ninterest everybody he met. After supper they had an hour together in the\\nroom.\\n\\n\\\"Those boys in the medical school surely do amuse me,\\\" he laughed. \\\"When\\nI tell 'em I'm to be a missionary doctor, which I do first thing to give\\n'em sort of a shock they don't often get, they stand off and say, 'What,\\nyou!' as if I had told 'em I was to be a traffic cop, or a trapeze\\nartist in the circus. Some of 'em seem to think I'm queer in the head,\\nbut, boys, they are the ones with rooms to let. When the others talk\\nabout hanging out a shingle in Chicago or Saint Louis or Cleveland or\\nsome other over-doctored place, I tell 'em to watch me, when I'm the\\nonly doctor between Siam and sunrise! Won't I be somebody? With my own\\nhospital--made out o' mud, I know--and a dispensary and a few native\\nhelpers who don't know what I'm going to do next, and all the sick\\npeople coming from ten days' journey away to the foreign doctor!\\\" And\\nthen his mood changed. \\\"That's what'll get me, though; all those\\nhelpless, ignorant humans who don't even know what I can do for their\\nbodies, let alone having any suspicion of what Somebody Else can do for\\ntheir souls! But it will be wonderful; next thing to being with him in\\nGalilee!\\\"\\n\\nThere was a pause, each boy filling it with thoughts he would not speak.\\n\\n\\\"Where do you expect to find that work, Joe?\\\" J.W. asked him.\\n\\nThe answer was quick and straight: \\\"Wherever I'm sent, J.W., boy,\\\" he\\nsaid. \\\"Only I've told the candidate secretary what I want. I met him\\nlast summer in Chicago, and there's nothing like getting in your bid\\nearly. He's agreed to recommend me, when I'm ready, for the hardest,\\nneediest, most neglected place that's open. If I'm going into this\\nmissionary doctor business, I want a chance to prove Christianity where\\nthey won't be able to say that Christianity couldn't have done it alone.\\nIt _can_!\\\"\\n\\nThen, with one of those quick turns which were Joe Carbrook's devices\\nfor concealing his feelings, he said, \\\"And how's everything going at\\nthis Methodist college of yours? Your boys put up a beautiful game\\nto-day, and they ought to have won. How's the rest of the school?\\\"\\n\\nBoth the boys assured him everything was going in a properly\\nsatisfactory fashion, but Marty had caught one word that he wanted Joe\\nto enlarge upon.\\n\\n\\\"Why do you say 'Methodist college'? It is a Methodist college; but is\\nthere anything the matter with that?\\\"\\n\\nJoe rose to the mild challenge. \\\"Don't think I mean to be nasty,\\\" he\\nsaid, \\\"but I can't help comparing this place with the State University,\\nand I wonder if there's any big reason for such colleges as this. You\\nknow they all have a hard time, and the State spends dollars to the\\nchurch's dimes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, we know that, don't we, J.W.?\\\" and Marty appealed to his chum,\\nremembering the frequent and half-curious talks they had on that very\\ncontrast.\\n\\nJ.W. said \\\"Sure,\\\" but plainly meant to leave the defense of the\\nChristian college to Marty, who, to tell the truth, was quite willing.\\n\\n\\\"There's room for both, and need for both,\\\" said that earnest young man.\\n\\\"Each has its work to do--the State University will probably help in\\nattracting most of those who want special technical equipment, and the\\nchurch colleges will keep on serving those who want an education for its\\nown sake, whatever special line they may take up afterward: though each\\nwill say it welcomes both sorts of students.\\\"\\n\\nThis suited Joe; he intended Marty to keep it up a while. So he said,\\n\\\"But why is a church college, anyway?\\\" And he got his answer, for Marty\\ntoo was eager for the fray.\\n\\n\\\"The church college,\\\" he retorted with the merest hint of asperity, \\\"is\\nat the bottom of all that people call higher education. The church was\\nfounding colleges and supporting them before the State thought even of\\nprimary schools. Look at Oxford and Cambridge--church colleges. Look at\\nHarvard and Yale and Princeton and the smaller New England\\ncolleges--church colleges. Look at Syracuse and Wesleyan and\\nNorthwestern and Chicago. Look at Vanderbilt, and most of the other\\ngreat schools of the South. They are church colleges, founded, most of\\nthem, before the first State University, and many before there was any\\npublic high school. The church college showed the way. If it had never\\ndone anything else, it has some rights as the pioneer of higher\\nlearning.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. had been getting more interested. He had never heard Marty in\\nquite this strain, and he was proud of him.\\n\\n\\\"That's a pretty good answer he's given you, Joe,\\\" he said with a\\nchuckle. \\\"Now, isn't it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is,\\\" admitted Joe. \\\"I reckon I knew most of what you say, Marty, but\\nI hadn't thought of it that way before. Now I want to ask another\\nquestion, only don't think I'm doing it for meanness; I've got a reason.\\nAnd my question is this: granting all that the church schools have done,\\nis it worth all they cost to keep them up now; in our time, I mean?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think it is,\\\" Marty answered, quieter now. \\\"They do provide a\\ndifferent sort of educational opportunity, as I said. Then, they are\\nproducing most of the recruits that the churches need for their work.\\nSince the churches began to care for their members in the State\\nUniversities, a rather larger number of candidates for Christian service\\nare coming out of the universities, but until the last year or two\\nnearly all came, and the very large majority still comes, and probably\\nfor years will come, from the church colleges. And there's another\\nreason that you State advocates ought to remember. Our Methodist\\ncolleges in this country have about fifty thousand students. If these\\ncolleges were to be put out of business, ten of the very greatest State\\nUniversities would have to be duplicated, dollar for dollar, at public\\nexpense, to take care of the Methodist students alone. When you think of\\nall the other denominations, you would need to duplicate all the State\\nUniversities now in existence if you purposed to do the work the church\\ncolleges are now doing. And if you couldn't get the money, or if the\\nstudents didn't take to the change, the country would be short just that\\nmany thousand college-trained men and women. The whole Methodist Church,\\nwith the other churches, is doing a piece of unselfish national service\\nthat costs up into the hundreds of millions, and where's any other big\\nmoney that's better spent?\\\"\\n\\nWhen Marty stopped he looked up into Joe's good-natured face, and\\nblushed, with an embarrassed self-consciousness. \\\"You think you've been\\nstringing me, don't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now, Marty,\\\" Joe spoke genially, \\\"don't you misunderstand. I said I had\\na reason. I have. My folks have some money they want to put into a safe\\nplace. And they like Cartwright. I do too, but--you know how it is. I\\nwant to be sure. Anyhow I'm glad I asked these questions. You've given\\nme some highly important information; and, honestly, I'm grateful. You\\nsurely don't think I'm small enough to be making fun of you, or of\\nCartwright. If I seemed to be, I apologize on the spot. Believe me?\\\" and\\nthere was no mistaking his genuine earnestness.\\n\\n\\\"Of course I believe you, old man,\\\" Marty rejoined, just a wee bit\\nashamed. \\\"Forgive me too, but I've been reading up on that college thing\\nlately, and it's a little different from what most people think. So you\\ngot me going.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm glad he did,\\\" said J.W. \\\"It makes me prouder than ever of\\nCartwright College.\\\" And, as he got up he said, as though still at the\\ngame, \\\"The 'locomotive' now!\\\" and gave Cartwright's favorite yell as a\\nsolo, while Marty and Joe grinned approval and some students passing in\\nthe street answered it with the \\\"skyrocket.\\\"\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nThere is material for a book, all mixt of interest varying from very\\nlight comedy to unplumbed gloom, in the life of two boys at college--any\\ntwo; and some day the chronicles of the Delafield Duo may be written;\\nbut not now.\\n\\nSenior year, with its bright glory and its seriously borne\\nresponsibilities. It found Marty a trifle less shy and reticent than\\nwhen he came to Cartwright, and J.W., Jr., a shade more studious. Marty\\nwould miss Phi Beta Kappa, but only by the merest fraction; J.W. would\\nrank about number twenty-seven in a graduating class of forty-five.\\nMarty had successfully represented his college twice in debate, and J.W.\\nhad played second on the nine and end in the eleven, doing each job\\nbetter than well, but rarely drawing the spotlight his way.\\n\\nCuriously enough, you had but to talk to Marty, and you would learn that\\nJ.W., Jr., was the finest athlete and the most popular student in\\nschool. Conversely, J.W., Jr., was prepared to set Cartwright's debating\\nrecord, as incarnated in Marty, against that of any other college in the\\nState. What was more, he cherished an unshakable confidence that the\\n\\\"Rev. Martin Luther Shenk\\\" would be one of the leading ministers of his\\nConference within five years.\\n\\nAnd so they came to commencement, with the Shenk and the Farwell\\nfamilies, Pastor Drury, and Marcia Dayne in the throng of visitors. Mr.\\nDrury rarely missed commencements at Cartwright, and naturally he could\\nnot stay away this year. The Farwells thought Marcia might like to see\\nher old schoolmates graduate, and the boys had written her that they\\nwanted somebody they could trot around during commencement week who\\nmight be trusted to join in the \\\"I knew him when\\\" chorus without being\\ntempted to introduce devastating reminiscences. And Marcia, being in\\nlove with life and youth, had been delighted to accept the combined\\ninvitation. She was not at all in love with either of the boys, nor they\\nwith her. They thought they knew where her heart had been given, and\\nthey counted Joe Carbrook a lucky man.\\n\\n\\\"Tell us, Marcia,\\\" said J.W., Jr., one afternoon, as the three of them\\nwere down by the lake, \\\"how it happens you went to the training school\\ninstead of the normal school last year.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's just like a man,\\\" said Marcia. \\\"Here am I, your awed and\\nadmiring slave, brought on to adorn the crowning event of your\\nscholastic career, and you don't even remember that I finished the\\nnormal school course in three years, and graduated a year ago!\\\"\\n\\nMarty rolled over on the sand in wordless glee.\\n\\n\\\"Aw, now, Marcia, why----\\\" J.W., Jr., boggled, fairly caught, but soon\\nrecovering himself. \\\"You must have been ashamed of it, then. I do\\nremember something about your getting through, now you mention the fact,\\nbut why didn't I receive an invitation? Answer me that, young lady!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, we educators don't think commencement amounts to so much as all\\nthat. With us, you know, life is real, life is earnest, and so forth.\\nBut I'll tell you the truth, J.W. I knew you couldn't come, either of\\nyou, and I was saving up a little on commencement expenses; so I left\\nyou--and a good many others--off the list. I needed the money, that's\\nthe simple fact; And the reason you didn't see me at home last summer\\nwas because I was busy spending the money I had saved on your\\ninvitations and other expensive things.\\\"\\n\\nMarty usually waited for J.W., but the idea which now occurred to him\\ndemanded utterance. \\\"Say, Marcia, I think it's fine of you to be\\nstudying dispensary work and first aid.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How did you know?\\\" Marcia demanded.\\n\\n\\\"Never mind; I saw Joe Carbrook in Chicago when we went through on our\\nway to the Buckland-Cartwright debate, and I guessed a good deal more\\nthan he told me, which wasn't much.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marty,\\\" said Marcia, her face aglow and her brave eyes looking into\\nhis, \\\"there's nothing secret about it. When Joe gets through medical\\nschool we shall go out together to whatever field they choose for him.\\nThe least I can do is to get ready to help.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is that why you've been going to training school?\\\" asked J.W. They had\\nso long been used to such complete frankness with each other that the\\nquestion was \\\"taken as meant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, J.W., it is,\\\" said Marcia. \\\"Joe has been doing perfectly splendid\\nwork in his medical course, and they say he will probably turn out to be\\na wonderful all-round doctor--everybody is surprised at his\\nthoroughness, except me. I know what he means by it. But, of course, he\\nhas little time for training in other sorts of religious work, and so,\\never since last June, I've been dividing my time between a settlement\\ndispensary and the training school. Why shouldn't I be as keen on my\\npreparation as he is on his, when we're going out to the same work?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You should, Marcia--you should,\\\" J.W. agreed, vigorously, \\\"and we're\\nproud of you; aren't we, Marty? I remember thinking two years ago what\\nfine missionary pioneers you two would make. Only trouble is, we'll\\nnever know anything about it, after we've once seen your pictures in\\n_The Epworth Herald_ among the recruits of the year. If you were only\\ngoing where a feller could hope to visit you once every two years or\\nso!\\\"\\n\\nMarcia looked out across the lake, but she wasn't seeing the white sails\\nthat glided along above the rippling blue of its waters. In a moment she\\npulled herself together, and observed that there had been enough talk\\nabout a mere visitor. \\\"What of you two, now that your student\\noccupation's gone?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tell her about yourself, Marty,\\\" said J.W. \\\"She knows what I'm going to\\ndo.\\\" And for the moment it seemed to him a very drab and unromantic\\nprospect, in spite of his agreement with Mr. Drury that all service\\nranks alike with God.\\n\\nMarty was always slow to talk of himself. \\\"It isn't much,\\\" he said. \\\"The\\ndistrict superintendent is asking me to fill out the year on the Ellis\\nand Valencia Circuit--the present pastor is going to Colorado for his\\nhealth. So I'm to be the young circuit-rider,\\\" and he smiled a wry\\nlittle smile. He had no conceit of himself to make the appointment seem\\npoor; rather he wondered how any circuit would consent to put up with a\\nboy's crude preaching and awkward pastoral effort.\\n\\nBut J.W., Jr., was otherwise minded. A country circuit for Marty did not\\naccord with his views at all. Marty was too good for a country church,\\nhe argued, mainly from his memories of the bare little one-room\\nmeetinghouse of his early childhood. In his periodical trips to the farm\\nhe had seen the old church grow older and more forlorn, as one family\\nafter another moved away, and the multiplying cars brought the town and\\nits allurements almost to the front gate of every farm.\\n\\nSo J.W. had tried to say \\\"No,\\\" for Marty, who would not say it for\\nhimself. It was one of the rare times when they did not see eye to eye.\\nBut it made no difference in their sturdy affection; nothing ever could.\\nAnd Marty would take the appointment.\\n\\nCommencement over, for the first time in many years the chums went their\\nseparate ways, Marty to his circuit, and J.W. home to Delafield. Then\\nfor a little while each had frequent dark-blue days, without quite\\nrealizing what made his world so flavorless. But that passed, and the\\nyoung preacher settled down to his preaching, and the young merchant to\\nhis merchandising; and soon all things seemed as if they had been just\\nso through the years.\\n\\nTo J.W. came just one indication of the change that college had made.\\nPastor Drury, though he found it wise to do much of his important work\\nin secret, thought to make use of the college-consciousness which most\\ntowns possess in June, and which is felt especially, though not\\nconfessed, by the college colony. The year's diplomas are still very new\\nin June. So a college night was announced for the social rooms, with a\\ncollege sermon to follow on the next Sunday night. The League and the\\nSenior Sunday School Department united to send a personal invitation to\\nevery college graduate in town, and to every student home for the\\nvacation. They responded, four score of them, to the college-night call.\\n\\nAs J.W. moved about and greeted people he had known for years he began\\nto realize that college has its own freemasonry. These other graduates\\nwere from all sorts of schools; two had been to Harvard, and one to\\nPrinceton; several were State University alumni. Cartwright was\\nrepresented by nine, six of them undergraduates, and the others\\nconfessed themselves as being from Chicago, Syracuse, De Pauw, three or\\nfour sorts of \\\"Wesleyan,\\\" Northwestern, Knox, Wabash, Western Reserve,\\nand many more.\\n\\nNot even all Methodist, by any means, J.W. perceived; and yet the\\nfellowship among these strangers was very real. They spoke each other's\\ntongue; they had common interests and common experiences. He told\\nhimself that here was a suggestion as to the new friends he might make\\nin Delafield, without forgetting the old ones. And the prospect of life\\nin Delafield began to take on new values.\\n\\nOn the next Sunday night not so many college people were out to hear Mr.\\nDrury's straight-thinking and plain-spoken sermon on \\\"What our town asks\\nof its college-trained youth\\\"; and a few of those who came were inclined\\nto resent what they called a lecture on manners and duty.\\n\\nBut to J.W. the sermon was precisely the challenge to service he had\\nbeen looking for. It made up for his feeling at commencement that he was\\n\\\"out of it.\\\" It completed all which Mr. Drury had suggested at the\\nInstitute camp fire four years ago, all that he himself had tried to say\\nat the decision service on the day after the camp fire; all that the\\npastor had urged two years ago when J.W., Jr., confessed to him his new\\nhesitations and uneasiness.\\n\\nThe pastor had not preached any great thing. He had simply told the\\ncollege folk in his audience that no matter where they had gone to\\nschool, many people had invested much in them, and that the investment\\nwas one which in its very nature could not be realized on by the\\noriginal investors. The only possible beneficiaries were either the\\nsuccessive college generations or the communities in which they found\\ntheir place. If they chose to take as personal and unconditional all the\\nbenefits of their education, none could forbid them that anti-social\\nchoice; but if they accepted education as a trust, a stewardship,\\nsomething to be used for the common good, they would be worth more to\\nDelafield than all the new factories the Chamber of Commerce could coax\\nto the town.\\n\\nAnd to those who might be interested in this view of education, Pastor\\nDrury said: \\\"Young people of the colleges, you have been trained to some\\nforms of laboratory work, in chemistry, in biology, in geology--yes,\\neven in English. I invite you to think of your own town of Delafield as\\nyour living laboratory, in which you will be at once experimenters and\\npart of the experiment stuff. Look at this town with all its good and\\nevil, its dying powers and its new forces, its dullnesses and its\\nenthusiasms, its folly and wisdom, its old ways and its new people, its\\nwealth and want. Do you think it is already becoming a bit of the\\nkingdom of God? Or, if you conclude that it seems to be going in ways\\nthat lead very far from the Kingdom, do you think it might possess any\\nKingdom possibilities? If you do, no matter what your occupation in\\nDelafield, Delafield itself may be your true vocation, your call from\\nGod!\\\"\\n\\nFor John Wesley Farwell, Jr., it was to become all of that.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\nEXPLORING MAIN STREET\\n\\nJ.W., Jr., found small opportunity to make himself obnoxious by becoming\\na civic missionary before the time. He was busy enough with his\\nadjustment to the business life of \\\"Delafield and Madison county,\\\" this\\nbeing the declared commercial sphere of the John W. Farwell Hardware\\nCompany. J.W. always had known hardware, but hitherto in a purely\\namateur and detached fashion. Now he lived with it, from tacks to\\ntractors, ten or twelve hours a day. He found that being the son of his\\nfather gained him no safe conduct through the shop or with the\\ncustomers. He had a lot to learn, even if he was John Wesley Farwell,\\nJr. That he was the heir apparent to all this array of cast iron and\\nwrought and galvanized, of tin and wire and steel and aluminum and\\nnickel, did not save him from aching back and skinned knuckles, nor from\\nthe various initiations staged by the three or four other employees.\\n\\nBut he was getting his bearings, and not from the store and the\\nwarehouse only. A good hardware store in a country town is a center of\\ndemocracy for town and country alike. In what other place do farmers and\\nartisans, country women and city women meet on so nearly equal terms?\\nNot in the postoffice, nor in the bank; and certainly not in the\\ndepartment store. But the hardware store's customers, men and women all,\\nare masters of the tools they work with; and whoso loves the tools of\\nhis craft is brother to every other craftsman.\\n\\nIt was in the store, therefore, that J.W. began to absorb some of the\\nknowledge and acquire some of the experiences that were to make his work\\nsomething to his town.\\n\\nFor one thing, he got a new view of local geography, in terms of tools.\\nAll the farmers from the bottoms of Mill Creek called for pretty much\\nthe same implements; the upland farms had different needs. The farmers'\\nwives who lived along the route of the creamery wagon had one sort of\\ntroubles with tinware; the women of the fruit farms another. J.W. knew\\nthis by the exchange of experiences he listened to while he sold milk\\nstrainers and canning outfits. He found out that the people on the edge\\nof town who \\\"made garden\\\" were particular about certain tools and\\nequipment which the wheat farmer would not even look at.\\n\\nAnd the townpeople he learned to classify in the same way. He was soon\\non good terms with those store clerks who were handy men about the\\nhouse, with women who did all their own work, with blacksmiths and\\ncarpenters, with unskilled laborers and garage mechanics. In time he\\ncould almost tell where a man lived and what he did for a living, just\\nby the hardware he bought and the questions he asked about it.\\nHeretofore J.W. had thought he knew most of the people in Delafield.\\nBut the first weeks in the store showed him that he knew only a few. Up\\nto this time \\\"most of the people in Delafield\\\" had meant, practically,\\nhis school friends, the clerks and salespeople in certain stores--and\\nthe members of the First Methodist Church.\\n\\nThat is to say, in the main, to him Delafield had been the church, and\\nthe church had been Delafield. But now he realized that his church was\\nonly a small part of Delafield. The town had other churches. It had\\nlodges. When the store outfitted Odd Fellows' Hall with new window\\nshades he learned that the Odd Fellows shared the place with strong\\nlodges of the Maccabees and Modern Woodmen. And there were other halls.\\nJ.W. Farwell, Sr., was a Mason, but these other lodges seemed to have as\\nmany members as the Masons, and one or the other of them was always\\ngetting ready for a big public display.\\n\\nThe same condition was true of the country people. He began to hear\\nabout the Farm Federation, and the Grange, and the Farmers' Elevator,\\nand the cooperative creamery, for members of all of these groups passed\\nin and out of the store.\\n\\nOne day J.W. remarked to the pastor who had dropped into the store: \\\"Mr.\\nDrury, I never noticed before how this place is alive with societies and\\nclubs and lodges and things. Everybody seems to belong to three or four\\norganizations. And they talk about 'em! But I don't hear much about our\\nchurch, and nothing at all about the old church out at Deep Creek. Yet\\nI used to think that the church was the whole thing!\\\"\\n\\nThe older man nodded. \\\"It's true, J.W.,\\\" he said, \\\"all the churches\\ntogether are only a small part of the community. They are the best, and\\nusually the best-organized forces we have, I'm sure of that; but the\\nchurch and the town have to reckon with these others.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What good are they all? They must cost a pile of money. What for?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's what you might call a whale of a question, J.W.\\\" John W.\\nFarwell, Senior, who had been standing by, listening, essayed to answer.\\n\\\"And you haven't heard yet of all the organizations. Look at me, for\\nexample. I belong to the Chamber of Commerce and the Rotary Club. I'm on\\nthe Executive Committee of the Madison County Horticultural Society, and\\nI've just retired from the Board of Directors of the Civic League. Then\\nyou must think of the political parties, and the County Sunday School\\nAssociation, and the annual Chautauqua, and I don't know what all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and I notice, dad, that a good many of these,\\\" said J.W., Jr.,\\n\\\"are just for the men. The women must have nearly as many. Why,\\nDelafield ought to be a model town, and the country 'round here ought to\\nbe a regular paradise, with all these helpers and uplifters on the job.\\nBut it isn't. Maybe they're not all on the job.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's about it, my boy,\\\" his father agreed \\\"I sometimes think we need\\njust one more organization--a society that would never meet, but between\\nthe meetings of all the other societies would actually get done the\\nthings they talk about and pass resolutions about and then go off and\\nforget until the next meeting.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, dad, what I want to find out,\\\" J.W. said, as he started off with\\nMr. Drury to the post office, \\\"is where the church heads in. Mr. Drury\\nis sure it has a big responsibility, and maybe it has. But what is it\\nwilling to do and able to do, and what will the town let it do? It seems\\nto me that is the question.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. heard his father's voice echoing after him up the street, \\\"Sure,\\nthat is the question,\\\" and Mr. Drury added, \\\"Three questions in one.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. found himself taking notice in a way he had not done before through\\nall his years in Delafield. As might be expected, he had come home from\\ncollege with new ideas and new standards. The town looked rather more\\nsordid and commonplace than was his boy's remembrance of it. Of late it\\nhad taken to growing, and a large part of its development had come\\nduring his college years. So he must needs learn his own town all over\\nagain.\\n\\nCherishing his young college graduate's vague new enthusiasm for a\\nbetter world, he had little sympathy with much that Delafield opinion\\nacclaimed as progress.\\n\\nThe Delafield Daily Dispatch carried at its masthead every afternoon one\\nor more of such slogans as these: \\\"Be a Delafield Booster,\\\" \\\"Boost for\\nmore Industries,\\\" \\\"Put Delafield on the Map,\\\" \\\"Double Delafield in Half\\na Decade,\\\" \\\"Delafield, the Darling of Destiny,\\\" \\\"Watch Delafield Grow,\\nbut Don't Stop Boosting to Rubber.\\\"\\n\\nThese were taken by many citizens as a sort of business gospel; any\\n\\\"theorist\\\" who ventured to question the wisdom of bringing more people\\nto town, whether the town's business could give them all a decent living\\nor not, was told to sell his hammer and buy a horn. J.W. said nothing;\\nhe was too young and too recent a comer into the town's business life.\\nBut he could not work up any zeal for this form of town \\\"loyalty.\\\"\\n\\nA big cannery had been built down near the river, where truck gardens\\nflourished, and there was a new furniture factory at the edge of the\\nfreight yards. Hereabouts a lot of supremely ugly flats had gone up, two\\nfamilies to each floor and three stories high; and in J.W.'s eyes the\\nrubbish and disorder and generally slattern appearance of the region was\\nno great addition to Delafield's attractions.\\n\\nStill more did the tumbledown shacks in the neighborhood of the cannery\\noffend the eyes and, to be frank, the ears and nose as well. It was a\\nforlorn-looking lot of hovels, occupied by listless, frowsy adults and\\nnoisy children. Here existence seemed to be a grim caricature of life;\\nthe children, the only symbol of abundance to be seen, continued to be\\ngrotesque in their very dirt. What clothes they had were second or\\nthird-hand garments too large for them, which they seemed to be\\nperpetually in danger of losing altogether.\\n\\nTo J.W., Delafield had always been a town of homes; but in these dismal\\nquarters there was little to answer to the home idea. They were merely\\nplaces where people contrived to camp for a time, longer or shorter;\\nnone but a Gradgrind could call them homes.\\n\\nOne of the factory foremen was a great admirer of Mr. Drury, who\\nintroduced him to J.W. one day when the foreman had come to the store\\nfor some tools. He had talked with J.W., and in time a rather casual\\nfriendliness developed between them. It was this same Foreman Angus\\nMacPherson, a Scot with a name for shrewdness, who gave the boy his\\nfirst glimpse of what the factory and the cannery meant to\\nDelafield--especially the factory.\\n\\nJ.W. was down at the factory to see about some new band-saws that had\\nbeen installed; and, his errand finished, he stopped for a chat with\\nAngus.\\n\\n\\\"This factory wasn't here when I went off to college,\\\" he said. \\\"What\\never brought it to Delafield?\\\"\\n\\nAt that MacPherson was off to a perfect start.\\n\\n\\\"Ye see, my boy,\\\" he began, \\\"Delafield is so central it is a good town\\nfor a good-working plant; freights on lumber and finished stuff are not\\nso high as in some places. And then there's labor. Lots of husky fellows\\naround here want better than farm wages, and they want a chance at town\\nlife as well. Men from the big cities, with families, hope to find a\\nquieter, cheaper place to live. So we've had no trouble getting help.\\nSkill isn't essential for most of the work. It's not much of a trick\\nnowadays to get by in most factories--the machines do most of the\\nthinking for you, and that's good in some ways. Only the men that 'tend\\nthe machines can't work up much pride in the output. Things go well\\nenough when business is good. But when the factory begins to run short\\ntime, and lay men off, like it did last winter, there's trouble.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. wanted to know what sort of trouble.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, well,\\\" said MacPherson, \\\"strikes hurt worst at the time, but\\nstrikes are just like boils, a sign of something wrong inside. And\\nshort-time and lay-offs--well, ye can't expect the factory to go on\\nmaking golden oak rockers just to store in the sheds. Somebody has to\\nbuy 'em. But the boys ain't happy over four-day weeks, let alone no jobs\\nat all.\\\"\\n\\nHis sociology professor at Cartwright, J.W. recalled, had talked a good\\ndeal about the labor question, but maybe this foreman knew something\\nabout it too. So J.W. put it up to him: \\\"What is at the bottom of it\\nall, MacPherson? What makes the thing the papers call 'labor unrest'?\\\"\\n\\nMacPherson hesitated a moment. Then he settled himself more comfortably\\non a pile of boards and proceeded to deliver his soul, or part of it.\\n\\n\\\"I can tell you; but there's them that would ship me out of town if I\\ntalked too much, so I'll have to be careful. John Wesley, you've got a\\ngrand name, and the church John Wesley started has a good name, though\\nit's not my church. I'm a Scot, you know. But I know your preacher, and\\nhe and I are of the same mind about this, I know. Well, then, if your\\nMethodist Church could find a method with labor, it would get hold of\\nthe same sort of common people as the ones who heard Jesus gladly. These\\nworking-men are not in the way of being saints, ye ken, but they think\\nthat somewhere there is a rotten spot in the world of factories and\\nshops and mills. They think they learn from experience, who by the way,\\nis the dominie of a high-priced school, that they get most of the losses\\nand few of the profits of industry. They get a living wage when times\\nare good. When times are bad they lose the one thing they've got to\\nsell, and that's their day's work; when a loafing day is gone there's\\nnothing to show for it, and no way to make it up. Maybe that's as it\\nshould be, but the worker can't see it, especially if the boss can still\\nbuy gasoline and tires when the plant is idle. Oh, yes, laddie, I know\\nthe working man is headstrong. I'll tell you privately, I think he's a\\nfool, because so often he gets into a blind rage and wants to smash the\\nvery tools that earn his bite and sup. He may have reason to hate some\\nemployer, but why hate the job? It's a good job, if he makes good\\nchairs. He goes on strike, many's the time, without caring that it hurts\\nhim and his worse than it hurts the boss. And often the boss thinks he\\nwants nothing bigger than a few more things. Maybe he _is_ wild for a\\nphonograph and a Ford and golden oak rockers of his own in the parlor,\\nand photographs enlarged in crayon hanging on the walls--and a steady\\njob. But, listen to me, John Wesley, Jr., and you'll be a credit to your\\nnamesake: these wild, unreasonable workers, with all their foolishness\\nand sometimes wickedness, are whiles dreaming of a different world, a\\nbetter world for everybody. 'Twould be no harm if some bosses dreamed\\nmore about that too, me boy. Your preacher--he's a fine man too, is Mr.\\nDrury--he understands that, and he wants to use it for something to\\nbuild on. That's why I tell folks he's a Methodist preacher with a real\\nmethod in his ministry. Now I'll quit me fashin' and get back to the\\njob. I doubt you'll be busy yourself this afternoon.\\\"\\n\\nHe gripped J.W.'s hand, so that the knuckles were unable to forget him\\nall day, but what he had said gripped harder than his handshake. If the\\nfurniture factory was a mixed blessing, what of the cannery?\\n\\nSomewhat to his own surprise, J.W. was getting interested in his town,\\nbut if at first he was inclined to wonder how he happened to develop all\\nthis new concern, he soon ceased to think of it. So slight a matter\\ncould not stay in the front of his thinking when he really began to know\\nsomething of the Delafield to which he had never paid much attention.\\n\\nIt was through Joe Carbrook that he got his next jolt. Joe, now spending\\nhis vacations in ways that amazed people who had memories of his wild\\nyounger manner, was in and out of the Farwell store a good deal. Also he\\nspent considerable time with Pastor Drury, though there is no record of\\nwhat they talked about.\\n\\n\\\"J.W., old boy,\\\" Joe asked one day, coming away from the pastor's\\nstudy, \\\"have you ever by any chance observed Main Street?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, yes,\\\" J.W. answered, \\\"seeing that two or three or four times a day\\nI walk six blocks of it back and forth to this store door, I suppose I\\nhave.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, that way,\\\" Joe came back at him, \\\"and you've seen me, a\\nthousand times. But did you ever observe me? My ears, for instance,\\\" and\\nhe put his hands over them. \\\"Which one is the larger?\\\"\\n\\nWithout in the least understanding what his friend was driving at, and\\nstupidly wondering if he ever had noticed any difference in Joe's ears,\\nJ.W. stared with inane bewilderment. \\\"Is one really larger than the\\nother?\\\" he asked, helplessly.\\n\\nJoe took his hands down, and laughed. \\\"I knew it,\\\" he said. \\\"You've\\nnever observed my ears, and yet you think you have observed Main Street.\\nAs it happens, each of my ears takes the same-sized ear-muff. But you\\ndidn't know it. Well, never mind ears; I'm thinking about Main Street.\\nWhat do you know of Main Street?\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. thought he could make up for the ear question. So he said, boldly,\\n\\\"Joe Carbrook, I can name every place from here to the livery barn\\nnorth, and from here to the bridge south, on both sides of the street.\\nWant me to prove it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, J.W., I don't. I reckon you can. But I believe you're still as\\nblind as I've been about Main Street, just the same. I know Chicago\\npretty well and I doubt if there's as big a percentage of graft and\\nlittleness and dollar-pinching and going to the devil generally on\\nState Street or Wabash Avenue as there is an Main Street, Delafield.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You're not trying to say that our business men are crooks, are you,\\nJoe?\\\" J.W. asked, with a touch of resentment. \\\"You know I happen to be\\nconnected with a business house on Main Street myself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sure, I know it, and there's Marshall Field's on State Street, and Lyon\\n& Healy's on Wabash Avenue, and Hart, Schaffner & Marx over by the\\nChicago River; just the same as here. But I--well, of course, there's a\\nstory back of it all. Mother heard a couple of weeks ago that one of our\\nold Epworth League girls was having a hard time of it--she's working at\\nthe Racket store, helping to support her folks. They've had sickness,\\nand the girl doesn't get big wages. So mother asked me to look her up.\\nMother can't get about very easily, you know, and since I'm studying\\nmedicine she seems to think I'm the original Mr. Fix-It. I made a few\\ndiscreet inquiries, discreet, that is, for me, and can you guess who\\nthat girl is? You can't, I know. Well, she's Alma Wetherell, and that's\\nthe identical girl who gave me such a dressing down one day at the\\nCartwright Institute four years ago. Remember? Say, J.W., that day she\\ntold me so much of the deadly truth about myself that I hated her even\\nmore for knowing what to say than I did for saying it. But she had a big\\nlot to do with waking me up, and I owe her something.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. had not remembered the Institute incident. But he recalled that\\nAlma was at Cartwright that summer, and he had seen her at church\\noccasionally since he came home from college. She was living in town and\\nworking in some store or other he knew, but that was all.\\n\\n\\\"What did you find out?\\\" he asked Joe.\\n\\n\\\"I found out enough so that Alma has a better job, and things are going\\neasier at home. But that was just a starter. My brave John Wesley, do\\nyou remember your college sociology and economics and civics and all the\\nrest? Never mind confessing; you don't; I didn't either. But I began to\\nreview 'em in actual business practice. First I told the right merchant\\nwhat sort of a bookkeeper I had found slaving away for ten dollars a\\nweek on the dark, smelly balcony of the Racket--and he's given Alma a\\njob at twenty in a sun-lighted office. Then I told Mr. Peters of the\\nRacket what I had done, and why. He didn't like it, but it will do him\\ngood. That made me feel able to settle anything, and I'm looking around\\nfor my next joy as journeyman rescuer and expert business adjuster.\\nHonest, J.W., I've not seen near all there is to see, but I'm swamped\\nalready. You've got to come along, you and some others, and see for\\nyourself what's the matter with Main Street.\\\"\\n\\nNot all at once, but before very long, J.W. shared Joe's aroused\\ninterest. Pastor Drury was with them, of course; and the three called\\ninto consultation a few other capable and trustworthy men and women.\\nMarcia Dayne had come home for a few weeks' holiday, and at once\\nenlisted. Alma Wetherell was able to give some highly significant\\nsuggestions.\\n\\nThere was no noise of trumpets, and no publicity of any sort. Mr. Drury\\ninsisted that what they needed first and most was not newspaper\\nattention, and not even organization, but exact information. So for many\\ndays a group of puzzled and increasingly astonished people set about the\\nstudy of their own town's principal street, as though they had never\\nseen it before. And, in truth, they never had.\\n\\nIt was no different from all other small town business districts. The\\nGem Theater vied with the Star and the Orpheum in lavish display of\\ngaudy posters advertising pictures that were \\\"coming to-morrow,\\\" and in\\ntwo weeks of observation the investigators learned what sort of moving\\npictures Delafield demanded, or, at least what sort it got. They took\\nnote of the Amethyst Coterie's Saturday night dances--\\\"Wardrobe, 50\\ncents, Ladies Free\\\"--and of the boys and girls who patronized the place.\\nThe various cigar and pocket-billiards combinations were quietly\\nobserved, some of the observers learning for the first time that young\\nmen are so determined to get together that they are not to be deterred\\nby dirt or bad air or foul and brainless talk.\\n\\nThe candy stores with soda fountains and some of the drug stores which\\nserved refreshments took on a new importance. Instead of being no more\\nthan handy purveyors of sweets, of soft drinks and household remedies,\\nthey were seen to be also social centers, places for \\\"dates\\\" and\\ntelephone flirtations and dalliance. Much of their doings was the merest\\nsilly time-killing, but generally the youthful patrons welcomed all this\\nbecause it was a change from the empty dullness of homes that had missed\\nthe home secret, and from the still duller and wasting monotony of\\nuninteresting toil.\\n\\nIt was Pastor Drury who suggested the explanation for all these forms of\\nprofitless and often dangerous amusement. He was chatting with the whole\\ngroup one night, and merely happened to address himself first to J.W.,\\nJr.\\n\\nYour great namesake, J.W., was so much a part of his day that he\\nbelieved with most other great religious thinkers of his time that play\\nwas a device of the devil. His belief belonged to eighteenth-century\\ntheology and psychology. But even more it grew out of the vicious\\ndiversions of the rich and the brutalizing amusements of the poor. Both\\nwere bad, and there was not much middle ground. But here on Main Street\\nwe see people, most of them young, who feel, without always\\nunderstanding why, that they simply must be amused. They feel it so\\nstrongly that they will pay any price for it if circumstances won't let\\nthem get it any other way. And Main Street is ready to oblige them.\\nThere could be no amusement business if people were not clamoring to be\\namused. And we know now why we have no right to say that all this clamor\\nis the devil's prompting. Isn't it queer that the church is only now\\nbeginning to believe in the genuineness and wholesomeness of the play\\ninstinct, though it is a proper and natural human hunger? Literally\\neverybody wants to play.\\n\\n\\\"People pay more for the gratification of this hunger than they do for\\nbread or shoes or education or religion. They take greater moral risks\\nfor it than they do for money. We have seen people who undoubtedly are\\ngoing to the devil by the amusement route, unless something is done to\\nstop them. They go wrong quicker and oftener in their play than in their\\nwork. Are we going to be content with denouncing the dance hall and the\\npoolroom and the vile pictures and the loose conduct of the soft-drink\\nplaces and Electric Park? Haven't we some sort of duty to see that every\\nyoung person in Delafield has a chance at first-hand, enjoyable, and\\ndecent play?\\\"\\n\\nAll agreed that the pastor was right, though they were not so clear\\nabout what could be done.\\n\\nBut commercialized amusement was not all they found in their quiet\\nvoyages of discovery up and down Main Street.\\n\\nThe chain stores had come to Delafield--not the \\\"5 and 10\\\" only, but\\nstores which specialized in groceries, tobacco, shoes, dry goods, drugs,\\nand other commodities. Alongside of them were the locally owned stores.\\nAltogether, Main Street had far too many stores to afford good service\\nor reasonable prices. With all this duplication on the one hand, and\\nabsentee-control on the other, Main Street was a street of\\nunderlings--clerks and salespeople and delivery men. That condition\\nproduced low wages and inefficient methods, many of the workers being\\ntoo young to be out of school and too dense to show any intelligence\\nabout the work they were supposed to do. Cheap help was costly, and the\\nefficient help was scarcely to be found at any price.\\n\\nThe investigators were frankly dismayed at the extent and complexity of\\nthe situation. They had thought to find occasional cases calling for\\nadjustment, or even for the law. But instead they had found a whole\\nfabric of interwoven questions--amusements, wages, competition,\\ncooperation, ignorance, vulgarity, vice, cheapness, trickery, \\\"business\\nis business.\\\" True, they had found more honest businesses than shady\\nones, more faithful clerks than shirkers, more decent people in the\\npleasure resorts than doubtful people. But the total of folly and evil\\nwas very great; could the church do anything to decrease it?\\n\\nAnd that question led the little company of inquisitive Christians into\\nyet wider reaches of inquiry. J.W. and Joe and Marcia at Mr. Drury's\\nsuggestion agreed to be a sort of unofficial committee to find out about\\nthe churches of Delafield. He told them that this was first of all a\\nwork for laymen. The preachers might come in later.\\n\\nJoe invited the others to the new Carbrook home on the Heights into\\nwhich his people had lately moved. The Heights was a new thing to\\nJ.W.--a rather exclusive residential quarter which had been laid out\\npark-wise in the last four or five years; with houses in the midst of\\nwide lawns, a Heights club house and tennis courts and an exquisite\\nlittle Gothic church.\\n\\n\\\"When our folks first talked about moving out here I thought it was all\\nright; and I do yet, in some ways,\\\" explained Joe. \\\"But the Heights is\\ngetting a little too good for me; I'm not as keen about being exclusive\\nas I used to be. I've thought lately that exclusiveness may be just as\\nbad for people inside the gates, as for the people outside. But here we\\nare, as the Atlantic City whale said when the ebb tide stranded it in\\nfront of the Board Walk. What are we up to, us three?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We're up to finding out about the town churches,\\\" said J.W. \\\"Maybe they\\ncan help the town more than they do, but we don't know how, and so far\\nwe haven't found anybody else who knows how.\\\"\\n\\nAnd Marcia said: \\\"At least we know some things. We have the figures.\\nAbout one Delafield citizen in seven goes to church or Sunday school on\\nSunday. Church membership is one in ten. And as many people go to the\\nmovies and the Columbia vaudeville and the dance halls and poolrooms on\\nSaturday as go to church on Sunday, to say nothing of the crowds that go\\non the other five days.\\\"\\n\\nJoe Carbrook whistled. \\\"That's a tough nut to crack, gentle people,\\\" he\\nsaid, \\\"because you've simply got to think of those other five days. The\\nchances are that four times as many people in Delafield go to other\\npublic places as go to church and Sunday school.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What can the churches do?\\\" asked J.W. \\\"You can't make people go to\\nchurch.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" assented Marcia, \\\"and if you could, it would be foolish. We want\\nto make people like the churches, not hate them. One thing I believe our\\nchurches can do is to put their public services more into methods and\\nforms that don't have to be taken for granted or just mentally dodged.\\nHalf the time people don't know what a religious service really stands\\nfor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Meaning by that----?\\\" Joe queried, as much to hear Marcia talk as for\\nthe sake of what she might say.\\n\\n\\\"Well, they have seen and heard it since they were children. When they\\nwere little they didn't understand it, and now it is so familiar that\\nthey forget they don't understand it,\\\" Marcia responded, not wholly\\noblivious of Joe's strategy, but too much in earnest to care. \\\"I've\\nheard of a successful preacher in the East who seems to be making them\\nunderstand. He says he tries to put into each service four\\nthings--light, music, motion; that is, change--and a touch of the\\ndramatic. Why not? I think it could be done without destroying the\\nsolemnity of the worship. They did it in the Temple at Jerusalem, and\\nthey do it in Saint Peter's at Rome and in Westminster Abbey and Saint\\nJohn's Cathedral in New York. Why shouldn't we do it here in our little\\nchurches?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Make a note of it, J.W.,\\\" ordered Joe. \\\"It's worth suggesting to some\\nof the preachers.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. made his note, rather absently, and offered a conclusion of his\\nown:\\n\\n\\\"The church must take note of the town's sore spots too. I've found out\\nthat crowding people in tenements and shacks means disease and\\nimmorality. Isn't that the church's affair? Angus MacPherson has taught\\nme that when the jobs are gone little crimes come, followed by bigger\\nones; and sickness comes too, with the death rate going up. Babies are\\nborn to unmarried mothers, and babies, with names or without, die off a\\nlot faster in the river shacks and the east side tenements than they do\\nup this way. Maybe the church couldn't help all this even if it knew;\\nbut I'm for asking it to know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll vote for that,\\\" Joe asserted, \\\"if you'll vote for my proposition,\\nwhich is this: our churches must quit trying just to be prosperous; they\\nmust quit competing for business like rival barkers at a street fair;\\nthey must begin to find out that their only reason for existence is the\\nservice they can give to those who need it most; they've got to believe\\nin each other and work with each other and with all the other town\\nforces that are trying to make a better Delafield.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's right,\\\" said J.W. \\\"I was talking to Mr. Drury this morning, and\\nI asked him what he would think of our starting a suggestion list. He\\nsaid it ought to be a fine thing. But he wants us to do it all\\nourselves. Just the same, we can take our suggestions to him, and then,\\nif he believes in them, he can talk to the other preachers about them,\\nand, of course, about any ideas of his own. Because you know, I'm pretty\\nsure he has been thinking about all this a good deal longer than we\\nhave.\\\"\\n\\nIt was agreed that the list should be started. Marcia was not willing\\nto keep it to themselves; she wanted to have it talked about in League\\nand Sunday school and prayer meeting, and then, when everybody had been\\ngiven the chance to add to it, and to improve on it--but not to weaken\\nit--that it be put out for general discussion among all the churches.\\n\\n\\\"And then,\\\" said Joe Carbrook, \\\"we might call it 'The Everyday Doctrines\\nof Delafield,' If we stick to the things every citizen will admit he\\nought to believe and do, the churches will still have all the chance\\nthey have now to preach those things which must be left to the\\nindividual conscience.\\\"\\n\\nThat was the beginning of a document with which Delafield was to become\\nvery familiar in the months which followed; never before had the town\\nbeen so generally interested in one set of ideas, and to this day you\\ncan always start a conversation there by mentioning the \\\"Everyday\\nDoctrines of Delafield,\\\" The Methodist preacher gave them their final\\nform, but he took no credit for the substance of them, though, secretly,\\nhe was vastly proud that the young people, and especially J.W., should\\nhave so thoroughly followed up his first suggestion of a civic creed.\\n\\nTHE EVERYDAY DOCTRINES OF DELAFIELD\\n\\n1. Every part of Delafield is as much Delafield as any other\\npart We are citizens of a commonwealth, and Delafield should\\nbe in fact as well as name a democratic community.\\n\\n2. Whenever two Delafield citizens can better do something\\nfor the town than one could do it, they should get together.\\nAnd the same holds good for twenty citizens, or a hundred, or\\na thousand. One of the town's mottoes should be, \\\"Delafield\\nIs Not Divided.\\\"\\n\\n3. Everything will help Delafield if it means better people,\\nin better homes, with better chances at giving their children the\\nright bringing-up, but anything which merely means more people,\\nor more money, or more business is likely to cost more than it\\ncomes to. We will boost for Delafield therefore, but we will\\nfirst be careful.\\n\\n4. Every part of Delafield is entitled to clean streets and plenty\\nof air, water, and sunlight. It is perhaps possible to be a Christian\\namid ugliness and filth, but it is not easy, and it is not\\nnecessary.\\n\\n5. Every family in Delafield has the right to a place that can\\nbe made into a home, at a cost that will permit of family self-respect,\\nproper privacy, and the ordinary decencies of civilized living.\\nEvery case of poverty in Delafield should be considered as\\na reflection on the town, as being preventable and curable by\\nremedies which any town that is careful of its good name\\ncan apply.\\n\\n6. Delafield believes that beauty pays better than ugliness.\\nTherefore she is for trees and flowers, green lawns, and clean\\nstreets, paint where it properly belongs, and everybody setting\\na good example by caring for his own premises and so inciting\\nhis neighbor to outdo him.\\n\\n7. The only industries Delafield needs are those which can\\nprovide for their operation without forcing workers to be idle\\nso much of the time as to reduce apparent income, and so to\\ncause poverty, sickness, and temptation to wrongdoing. The\\nstandard of income ought to be for the year, and not by the\\nday; in the interest of homes rather than in the interest of lodging\\nhouses and lunch rooms.\\n\\n8. Delafield can support, or should find ways to support, the\\nworkers needed in her stores, shops, and factories, at fair pay,\\nwithout making use of children, who should continue in school,\\nand without reckoning on the desperation of those made poor\\nby their dependence on a job.\\n\\n9. Amusements in Delafield can be and ought to be clean,\\nself-respecting, and available for everybody. This calls for playgrounds\\nand weekday playtime, as well as plenty of recreational\\nopportunities provided by the churches, without money-making\\nfeatures.\\n\\n10. The forms of amusement provided for pay can be and\\nshould be influenced by public opinion, positively expressed,\\nrather than by public indifference. Any picture house would\\nrather be praised for bringing a good picture to town than condemned\\nfor showing a bad one. Picture people enjoy praise as much as preachers\\ndo.\\n\\n11. Delafield's many organizations should tell the whole town\\nwhat they are trying to do, so that unnecessary duplication of\\nplan and purpose may first be discovered and then done away with.\\n\\n12. Whenever a Delafield church, or club, or society, proposes\\nto engage in a work that is to benefit the town, the plan ought\\nto be made known, and in due time the results should be published\\nas widely as was the plan. This will help us to learn by\\nour Delafield failures as well as by our Delafield successes.\\n\\n13. The churches of Delafield are Delafield property, as the\\nschools are, though paid for in a different way. Neither schools\\nnor churches exist for their own sakes, but for Delafield, and\\nthen some.\\n\\n14. Every church in Delafield should have a definite parish,\\nand every well-defined section or group should have a church.\\nThe churched should lead in providing for the unchurched, and\\nthe overchurched might spare out of their abundance of workers\\nand equipment some of the resources that are needed.\\n\\n15. The first concern of all the churches should be to reach\\nthe unchurched and to make church friends of the church-haters.\\nThis goes for all the churches; it is more important to get the\\nsense of God and principles of Jesus into the thought of the\\nwhole town than to set Protestant and Roman Catholic in mutually\\nsuspicious and hateful opposition; devout Jew and sincere\\nChristian must realize that righteousness in Delafield cannot be\\nattended to by either without the other.\\n\\n16. The churches of Delafield believe that all matters of social\\nconcern--work, wages, housing, health, amusement, and morals--are\\npart of every church's business. Therefore they will not\\ncease to urge their members always to deal with these matters as\\nChristian citizens, not merely as Christians.\\n\\n17. Every child and young person in Delafield ought to be in\\nthe day school on weekdays, and in Sunday school on Sunday.\\nDelafield discourages needless absence from one as much as\\nfrom the other.\\n\\n18. Delafield wants the best possible teachers teaching in all\\nher schools. She insists on trained teachers on week days, and\\nneeds them on Sundays. Therefore she believes that teacher-training\\nis part of every church's duty to Delafield.\\n\\n\\\"There's one thing about all this that bothers me,\\\" said J.W. when they\\nhad finished the final draft of the Every Day Doctrines, \\\"not that it's\\nthe only one; but some of these Doctrines stand small chance of being\\nput into practice until the church people are willing to spend more\\nmoney on such work. It can't be done on the present income of the\\nchurches, or by the usual money-raising methods.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's a fact,\\\" Joe Carbrook agreed. \\\"I'd already made up my mind that\\nthe Carbrooks would have to dig a little deeper, and so must everybody\\nelse who cares.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, but how to get everybody else to care; that's the trouble,\\\" J.W.\\npersisted. \\\"Dad's one of the stewards, you know, and they find it no\\neasy job to collect even what the church needs now. They have a deficit\\nto worry with every year, almost.\\\"\\n\\nMarcia Dayne was the only other member of the \\\"Let's Know Delafield\\\"\\ngroup who happened to be present at this last meeting. She had been\\nwaiting for a chance to speak. \\\"I'm surprised at you two,\\\" she said.\\n\\\"Don't you know the only really workable financial way out?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, not exactly,\\\" J.W. admitted. \\\"I suppose if we could only get\\npeople to care more, they would give more. It's a matter of letting them\\nknow the need and all that, I guess. For instance--\\\"\\n\\nMarcia was not ready for his \\\"for instances.\\\" \\\"John Wesley, Jr.,\\\" she\\ninterrupted with mock severity, \\\"as a thinker you have shone at times\\nwith a good deal more brilliance than that. If you had said it just the\\nother way 'round you would have been nearer right. People _will_ give if\\nthey care, of course, but it is even more certain that they will care if\\nthey give. The thing we need is to show them how to give.\\\"\\n\\nJoe Carbrook broke into an incredulous laugh. \\\"In other words, my fair\\nMarcia, you want Christians to give before they care what it is they are\\ngiving to, or even know about it. Don't you think our church will be a\\nlong time financing the Every Day Doctrines on that system?\\\"\\n\\nJoe and Marcia never hesitated to take opposite sides in a discussion,\\nand always with good-humored frankness. So Marcia came back promptly: \\\"I\\nknow you think it unreasonable,\\\" she said, \\\"but there's a condition you\\noverlook. We became Christians long before any of us thought about\\nstudying Delafield's needs. And if we and all the rest of the Christians\\nof the town had accepted our financial relation to the Kingdom and had\\nacted on it from the start, there would always be money enough and to\\nspare.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes,\\\" Joe said understandingly, \\\"I see now. You mean the tithe.\\\"\\n\\nMarcia knew, no matter how, that Joe had begun to think about tithing,\\nand this seemed the opportune time to stress it a little more. It could\\nhelp the Every Day Doctrines, and both Joe and J.W. were keen for that.\\n\\nSo Marcia admitted that she did mean the tithe. \\\"I don't pretend to know\\nhow it began, any more than I know how real homes were established after\\nthe Fall, or how keeping Sunday began; I do know these began long before\\nthere was any fourth or fifth commandment, or any Children of Israel.\\nAnd I've gone over all the whole subject with Mr. Drury--he has a lot of\\npractical pamphlets on the tithe. I believe that it is the easiest,\\nsurest, fairest and cheerfulest way of doing two Christian things at\\nonce--acknowledging God's ownership of all we have, and going into\\npartnership with God in his work for the world, what the books sometimes\\ncall Christian Stewardship.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'd like to see those pamphlets,\\\" said J.W.\\n\\n\\\"It's queer you haven't seen them before this,\\\" said Marcia. \\\"Mr. Drury\\nhas distributed hundreds of them. But maybe that was when you were away\\nat Cartwright. Anyway, I'll get some for you.\\\"\\n\\nJoe was holding his thought to the main matter. \\\"Marcia,\\\" said he, \\\"if\\nyou can make good on what you said just now, pamphlets or no pamphlets,\\nI'll agree to become a tither. First, to start where you did, how is\\ntithing easier than giving whenever you feel like giving?\\\"\\n\\nNow, though Marcia expected no such challenge, she was game. \\\"I'm not\\nthe one to prove all that, but I believe what I said, and I'll try to\\nmake good, as you put it. But please don't say 'give' when you talk\\nabout tithing, or even about any sort of financial plan for Christians.\\nThe first word is 'pay,' Giving comes afterward. Well, then; tithing is\\nthe easiest way, because when you are a tither you always have tithing\\nmoney. You begin by setting the tenth apart for these uses, and it is no\\nmore hardship to pay it out than to pay out any other money that you\\nhave been given with instructions for its use.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not bad, at all,\\\" said Joe. \\\"Now tell us why it is the surest way of\\nusing a Christian's money.\\\"\\n\\nBy this time Marcia was beginning to enjoy herself. \\\"It is the surest\\nbecause it almost collects itself. No begging; no schemes. You have\\ntithing money on hand--and you have, almost always--therefore you don't\\nneed to be coaxed into thinking you can spare it. If the cause is a real\\nclaim, that's all you need to find out. And when you begin to put money\\ninto any cause you're going to get interested in that cause. Besides,\\nwhen all Christians tithe there will be more than enough money for every\\ngood work.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. had not thought much of the tithe except as being one of those\\nreligious fads, and he knew that every church had a few religious\\nfaddists. But he had long cherished a vast respect for Marcia's good\\nsense, and what she was saying seemed reasonable enough. He wondered if\\nit could be backed up by evidence.\\n\\nJoe smilingly took up the next excellence of the tithe which Marcia had\\nnamed. \\\"Let me see; did you say that the tithe is the fairest of all\\nChristian financial schemes?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not that, exactly,\\\" Marcia corrected. \\\"I said it was the fairest way of\\nacknowledging God's ownership and of working with him in partnership.\\nAnd it is. It puts definiteness in the place of whim. It is proportional\\nto our circumstances. It is not difficult. Mr. Drury says that forty\\nyears' search has failed to find a tither who has suffered hardship\\nbecause of paying the tithe.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, Joe,\\\" J.W. put in, \\\"if Marcia can produce the evidence on these\\nthree points, you may as well take the fourth for granted. If tithing is\\nthe easiest, surest and fairest plan of Christian Stewardship, seems to\\nme it's just got to be cheerful. I'm going to look into it, and if she's\\nright, as I shouldn't wonder, it's up to you and me to get our finances\\nonto the ten per cent basis.\\\"\\n\\nJoe was never a reluctant convert to anything. When he saw the new way,\\nhis instinct was for immediate action. \\\"Let's go over to Mr. Drury's,\\\"\\nhe proposed, \\\"and see if we can't settle this thing to-day. I hope\\nMarcia's right,\\\" and he looked into her eyes with a glance of something\\nmore than friendly, \\\"and if she is I'm ready to begin tithing to-day.\\\"\\n\\nPastor Drury, always a busy man, reckoned interviews like this as urgent\\nbusiness always. Not once nor twice, but many times in the course of a\\nyear, his quiet, indirect work resulted in similar expeditions to his\\nstudy, and as a rule he knew about when to expect them. He produced the\\npamphlets, added a few suggestions of his own, and let the three young\\npeople do most of the talking. They stayed a long time, no one caring\\nabout that.\\n\\nAs they were thanking the pastor, before leaving, Joe said with his\\nusual directness, \\\"Marcia _was_ right, and here's where I begin to be a\\nsystematic Christian as far as my dealings with money are concerned.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W., not in the least ashamed to follow Joe's lead, said, \\\"Same here.\\nWish I'd known it sooner. Now we've got to preach it.\\\"\\n\\nAnd Joe said to Mr. Drury, in the last moment at the door, \\\"Mr. Drury,\\nif we could all get a conscience about the tithe, and pay attention to\\nthat conscience, half the Everyday Doctrines would not even need to be\\nstated. They would be self-evident. And the other half could be put into\\npractice with a bang!\\\"\\n\\nThe Delafield _Dispatch_ got hold of a copy of the \\\"Everyday Doctrines\\\"\\nand printed the whole of it with a not unfavorable editorial comment,\\nunder the caption \\\"When Will All This Come True?\\\"\\n\\nBut Walter Drury, when he saw it, said to himself, \\\"It has already come\\ntrue in a very real sense, for John Wesley, Jr., and these others\\nbelieve in it.\\\" And he knew it marked one more stage of the Experiment,\\nso that he could thank God and take courage.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n\\nHERE THE ALIEN; THERE THE LITTLE BROWN CHURCH\\n\\nIt was all very well to work out the \\\"Everyday Doctrines of Delafield.\\\"\\nTo secure their adoption and application by all the churches of\\nDelafield was another matter. The unofficial committee scattered, for\\none thing. Joe Carbrook went back to medical school, and Marcia to the\\nsettlement and the training school. Marty was traveling his circuit. J.\\nW. and the pastor and a few others continued their studies of the town.\\nNobody had yet ventured to talk about experts, but it began to be\\nevident that the situation would soon require thoroughgoing and skilled\\nassistance. Otherwise, all that had been learned would surely be lost.\\n\\nOne day in the late fall a stranger dropped in at the Farwell Hardware\\nStore and asked for Mr. J.W. Farwell, Jr. He had called first on Pastor\\nDrury, who was expecting him; and that diplomat had said to him, \\\"Go see\\nJ.W. I think he'll help you to get something started.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W., with two of the other clerks, was unloading a shipment of\\nstovepipes. The marks of his task were conspicuous all over him, and he\\nscarcely looked the part of the public-spirited young Methodist. But\\nthe visitor was accustomed to know men when he saw them, under all\\nsorts of disguises.\\n\\nJ.W., called to the front of the store, met the visitor with a\\ngood-natured questioning gaze.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Farwell, I am Manford Conover, of Philadelphia. Back there we have\\nheard something of the 'Everyday Doctrines of Delafield,' and I've been\\nsent to find out about them--and their authors.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sent?\\\" J.W. repeated. \\\"Why should anybody send you all the way from\\nPhiladelphia to Delafield just for that?\\\" He could not know how much\\npastoral and even episcopal planning was back of that afternoon call.\\n\\n\\\"Don't think that we reckon it to be unimportant, Mr. Farwell,\\\" said Mr.\\nConover, pleasantly. \\\"You see I'm from a Methodist society with a long\\nname and a business as big as its name--the Board of Home Missions and\\nChurch Extension. The thing some of you are starting here in Delafield\\nis our sort of thing. It may supply our Board with new business in its\\nline, and what we can do for you may make your local work productive of\\nlasting results, in other places as well as here.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. did not quite understand, but he was willing to be instructed, for\\nhe had found out that the effort to promote the \\\"Everyday Doctrines\\\" was\\nforever developing new possibilities and at the same time revealing new\\nexpanses of Delafield ignorance and need. Anybody who appeared to have\\nintelligence and interest was the more welcome.\\n\\nThey talked a while, and then, \\\"I'll tell you what,\\\" proposed J.W.\\n\\\"How long do you expect to be in town?\\\" Mr. Conover replied that as yet\\nhe had made no arrangement for leaving.\\n\\n\\\"Then let's get together a few people to-night after prayer meeting. Our\\npastor, of course, and the editor of the _Dispatch_--he's the right\\nsort, if he does boost 'boosting' a good deal; and Miss Leigh, of the\\nHigh School--she's all right every way; and Mrs. Whitehill, the\\npresident of the Woman's Association of our church--that's the women's\\nmissionary societies and the Ladies' Aid merged into one--she's a\\nregular progressive; and Harry Field, who's just getting hold of his job\\nin the League; and the Sunday school superintendent. That's dad, you\\nknow; he's had the job for a couple of years now, and he's as keen about\\nit as Harry is over the League.\\\"\\n\\nThey got together, and out of that first simple discussion came all\\nsorts of new difficulties for Delafield Methodism to face and master.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nManford Conover was a preacher with a business man's training and\\nviewpoint. He may have mentioned his official title, when he first\\nappeared, but nobody remembered it. When people couldn't think of his\\nname he was \\\"the man from the Board,\\\" which was all the same to him.\\n\\nAfter that first night's meeting Conover gave several days to walks\\nabout Delafield. J.W. had found the shacks and the tenements, and Joe\\nCarbrook had introduced J.W. to Main Street, but it was left to\\nConover to show him Europe and Africa in Delafield.\\n\\nThere's a certain town in a Middle Western State, far better known than\\nDelafield, rich, intelligent, highly self-content. Its churches and\\nschools and clubs are matters for complacent satisfaction. And you would\\nbe safe in saying that not one in five of its well-to-do people know\\nthat the town has a Negro quarter, an Italian section, a Bohemian\\nsettlement, a Scandinavian community, a good-sized Greek colony, and\\nsome other centers of cultures and customs alien to what they assume is\\nthe town's distinctive character.\\n\\nThey know, of course, that such people live in the town--couldn't help\\nknowing it. Their maids are Scandinavian or Negro. They buy vegetables\\nand candy from the Greeks. They hear of bootlegging and blind tigers\\namong certain foreign groups. The rough work of the town is done by men\\nwho speak little or no English. But all this makes small impression. It\\nis a commonplace of American town life. And scarcely ever does it\\npresent itself as something to be looked into, or needing to be\\nunderstood.\\n\\nSo Conover found it to be with Delafield. The \\\"Everyday Doctrines\\\" were\\nwell enough, but he knew a good deal of spade work must be done before\\nthey could take root and grow. He fronted a condition which has its\\ncounterpart in most American towns, each of which is two towns, one\\nbeing certain well-defined and delimited areas where languages and\\nBraces live amid conditions far removed from the American notion of\\nwhat is endurable, and the other the \\\"better part of town,\\\" sometimes\\nsmugly called \\\"the residence section,\\\" where white Americans have homes.\\n\\nConover and Pastor Drury compared notes. They were of one mind as to the\\nconditions which Conover had found, conditions not surprising to the\\nminister, who knew more about Delafield than any of his own people\\nsuspected.\\n\\nOne afternoon they met J.W. on the street, and he led them into a candy\\nstore for hot chocolate.\\n\\nAs they sipped the chocolate they talked; J.W., as usual, saying\\nwhatever he happened to think of.\\n\\n\\\"Say, Mr. Conover,\\\" he remarked, \\\"I notice in all your talk about the\\nforeigner in America you haven't once referred to the idea of the\\nmelting pot. Don't you think that's just what America is? All these\\npeople coming here and getting Americanized and assimilated and all\\nthat?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'd think America was the melting pot if I could see more signs of the\\nmelting,\\\" Conover answered. \\\"But look at Delafield; how much does the\\nmelting pot melt here?\\\"\\n\\nThen he looked across the store. \\\"Do you know the proprietor, Mr.\\nFarwell?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, indeed; Nick and I are good friends,\\\" answered J.W.\\n\\n\\\"Then I wish you'd introduce me,\\\" returned Conover.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Nick,\\\" J.W. called, \\\"will you come over here a minute?\\\"\\n\\nNick came, wiping his hands on his apron.\\n\\n\\\"Nick,\\\" said J.W., doing the honors, \\\"you know Mr. Drury, the pastor of\\nour church. And this is Mr. Conover from Philadelphia, a very good\\nfriend of ours. He's been looking around town, and wants to ask you\\nsomething.\\\"\\n\\nNick's brisk and cheerful manner was at its best, for he liked J.W.,\\nbesides liking the trade he brought.\\n\\n\\\"Sure,\\\" said he, \\\"I tell him anything if I know it. Glad for the\\nchance.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Dulas,\\\" said Conover--he had taken note of the name on the window,\\n\\\"you know the East Side pretty well, do you? Then, you know that many\\nItalians live just north of Linden Street, and there's a block or so of\\nPolish homes between Linden and the next street south?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sure I do,\\\" said Nick, confidently, \\\"I live on other side of them\\nmyself. See 'em every day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well,\\\" Conover went on. \\\"What I want to know is this: how do the\\nItalians and the Poles get along together?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They don't have nothing much to do with one another,\\\" Nick replied.\\n\\\"It's like this, the Poles they talk Polish, and maybe a little English.\\nThe Italians, they speak Italian, and some can talk English, only not\\nmuch. But Poles they can't talk Italian at all, and Italians can't talk\\nPolish. So how could they get together?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's just the question, Mr. Dulas,\\\" Conover agreed. \\\"I'm telling\\nthese gentlemen that it is harder for the different foreign-born people\\nto know one another and to be friendly with one another than it is for\\nthem to know and associate with Americans.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sure, Mister,\\\" Nick said, with great positiveness. \\\"Sure. Before I\\nspeak English I know nobody but Greeks, and when I start learning\\nEnglish I got no time to learn Polish, or Italian, or whatever it is.\\nEnglish I got to speak, if I run a candy store, but not those other\\nlanguages.\\\"\\n\\nAnd he went off to serve a customer who had just entered.\\n\\n\\\"There you have that side,\\\" said Conover to the minister and J.W. \\\"The\\nneed of English as an Americanizing force, and the meed of it as a\\nmedium of communication between the different foreign groups. Looks as\\nthough we've got to bear down hard on English, don't you think?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As Nick says, 'Sure I do,'\\\" Mr. Drury assented. \\\"It will come out all\\nright with the children, I hope; they're getting the English. But it\\nmakes things hard just now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What can the church do?\\\" J.W. put in. \\\"Should it undertake to teach\\nEnglish, as that preacher taught Phil Khamis, you remember, Mr. Drury;\\nor Americanization, or what?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think it should do something else first,\\\" said Conover. \\\"Why should\\nwe Americans try to make Europeans understand us, unless we first try to\\nunderstand them? Isn't ours the first move?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But this is the country they're going to live in,\\\" returned J.W. \\\"They\\ncan't expect us to adjust ourselves to European ways. They've got to do\\nthe adjusting, haven't they?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why?\\\" Conover came back. \\\"Because we were here first? But the Indian\\nwas here before us. We told him he needn't do any adjusting at all, and\\nsee what we've made of him. Maybe these Europeans can add enriching\\nelements to our American culture.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I guess so, but\\\"--and J.W. was evidently at a loss--\\\"but they've got\\nto obey our laws, you know, and fit into our civilization. The Indian\\nwas different. We couldn't make Indians of ourselves, and he wouldn't\\nbecome civilized.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Americanized, you mean?\\\" and Conover laughed a little at the irony of\\nit.\\n\\n\\\"No, no; not that. But he wouldn't meet us half way, even,\\\" J.W. said.\\n\\n\\\"I think,\\\" suggested Pastor Drury, \\\"that what Mr. Conover means is that\\nwe'd better be a little less stiff to newcomers than the Indian was to\\nus. Am I right?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Exactly right,\\\" returned Conover. \\\"Europe is in a general way the\\nmother-land of us all. But many of her children were late in getting\\nhere. The earlier ones have made their contributions; why may not the\\nlater ones also bring gifts for our common treasure?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, what in particular do you mean?\\\" asked J.W., who was finding\\nhimself adrift. He had been quite willing in the Institute days to be an\\nadmirer of Phil Khamis, and to forget that Phil was of alien birth; but\\nthis was something more complicated.\\n\\n\\\"Particulars are not so simple,\\\" Conover said. \\\"But, for instance: some\\nEuropean peoples have a fine musical appreciation. Some delight in\\noratory. Some are mystical and dreamy. Some are very children in their\\nlove of color. Some are almost artists in their feeling for beauty in\\ntheir work. Some do not enjoy rough play, and others cannot endure to be\\nquiet. Some have inherited a passionate love of country, and great\\ntraditions of patriotism.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We can't value all these things in just the way they do, but at least\\nwe can believe that such interests and instincts are worth something to\\nAmerica. Then our Americanization work will be not only more intelligent\\nbut far more sympathetic.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If I may turn to the immediate business,\\\" Mr. Drury said with a smile\\nof apology, \\\"suppose you tell J.W. what your Board has to suggest for us\\nhere in Delafield, Mr. Conover?\\\"\\n\\nConover turned to J.W. \\\"I wonder if you know anything about Centenary\\nChurch?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"That little old brick barn over in the East Bottoms? Why, yes, or I\\nused to; if was quite a church when I was a youngster, but I haven't\\nbeen that way lately. I guess it's pretty much run down, with all those\\nforeigners moving in. Most of the old members have probably moved away.\\nI know there were two Methodist boys with me in high school who lived\\ndown there, but they've moved up to the Heights. One of them lives next\\nto the Carbrooks.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Drury should take you down that way one of these days,\\\" said\\nConover, \\\"and you'd find that when your friends moved out of the church\\nthe foreigners who live nearby did not move in. Centenary Church is run\\ndown, as you say.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Drury added, \\\"And the few members who are left don't know which way\\nto turn. They have a supply pastor, who isn't able to do much. He gets a\\npitiful salary, but they can't pay more, and there's no money at all,\\nnor any accommodations, for any special attention to the newcomers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Conover, \\\"I'm instructed to tell you Delafield Methodists\\nthat the Board of Home Missions and Church Extension is ready to help\\nmake a new Centenary Church, for the people who now live around it. We\\nhave a department that pays special attention to immigrant and alien\\npopulations. Our workers know, in general, what is needed. We can put\\nsome trained people into Centenary, with a pastor who knows how to\\ndirect their work. I should not be surprised to see a parish house\\nthere, and a modernized church building, and a fine array of everyday\\nwork being done there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My, but that sounds great, Mr. Drury, doesn't it?\\\" asked J.W., in a\\nglow of enthusiasm. Then he checked himself. \\\"It sounds well enough,\\\" he\\nsaid, \\\"but all that means a lot of money. Where's the money to come\\nfrom?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"From you, of course,\\\" Conover replied, \\\"but not all or most from you.\\nMy Board is a benevolent board--that is to say, it is the whole church\\nat work in such enterprises as this. That's one way in which its share\\nof the church's benevolent offerings is used\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you don't mean to tell us,\\\" said J.W., incredulously, \\\"that you can\\ndrop in on a place like Delafield, make up your mind what is needed, and\\nthen dump a lot of money into a played-out church, just like that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, it's not so informal as all that,\\\" Conover said, \\\"The thing has to\\ngo through the official channels, of course. Your district\\nsuperintendent and Brother Drury and the Bishop and several others have\\nhad a hand in it already. All concerned have agreed as to the needs and\\npossibilities. But Delafield is also a good place to put on a\\ndemonstration, an actual, operating scheme. I have been making ready for\\na survey of the whole East Side, just a preliminary study, and before\\nanything positive is done we must make a more thorough inquiry. We\\nexpect to find out everything that needs to be known.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There was only one anxiety I had about it,\\\" Pastor Drury said, \\\"and\\nthat has been all taken away. I was keen to have this be a truly\\nChristian demonstration--not just a settlement or a parish house or\\nnight school classes, but a real demonstration of Christian service\\namong people who now know little about it. In some places these\\nactivities are being set going because church people know they ought to\\ndo something, and it is easier to give money and have gymnasiums and\\nmoving pictures than to make real proof of partnership with Christ by\\npersonal service and sacrifice. Take your old friend Martin Luther\\nShenk, J.W.--do you know that he's working at this very difficulty? And\\nI hear he's finding, even in the country, that some people will really\\ngive themselves, while others will give only their money and their\\ntime.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. thought of Win-My-Chum week, and how he had had to drive himself to\\nspeak to Marty, so he knew the pastor was right. And he went home with\\nall sorts of questions running through his mind, but with no very\\nsatisfying answers to make them.\\n\\nComing back in a wakeful night to Mr. Drury's casual mention of Marty,\\nthe thought of his chum set him to wondering how that sturdy young\\nitinerant was making it go on the Ellis and Valencia Circuit, just as\\nthe pastor guessed it might. To wonder was to decide. He would take a\\nlong-desired holiday. A word or two with his father in the morning gave\\nhim the excuse for what he wanted to do. Then he got Valencia on the\\nlong distance, and the operator told him she would find the \\\"Reverend\\\"\\nShenk for him in a few minutes. He had started out that morning to visit\\nalong the State Line Highway, as it was part of her business to know. At\\nthe third try Marty was found, and he answered J.W.'s hail with a shout.\\n\\nAfter the first exchange of noisy greetings, \\\"Say, Marty, dad's asked me\\nto run down in your part of the world and look at some new barn\\nfurniture that's been put in around Ellis--ventilators and stanchions\\nand individual drinking cups for the Holsteins--not like the way we used\\nto treat the cows on our farm, hey? Well, what do you say if I turn\\nfashionable for once and come down for the week-end--not this week, but\\nnext?\\\"\\n\\nNo need to ask Marty a question like that. \\\"Come on down. Make it Friday\\nand I'll show you the sights. We've got something doing at the Ellis\\nChurch, something I want you to see.\\\"\\n\\nThen Marty thought of a few books that he had left at home--\\\"And--hello,\\nJ.W., are you listening? Well, how'd you like to go out to the farm\\nbefore you come down here? Jeanette has gathered a bundle of my books,\\nand I need 'em. Won't you get 'em for me and bring them along?\\\"\\n\\nCertainly, J.W. would. The farm was home to both the boys, and J.W. was\\nalmost as welcome there as Marty; to one member of the family quite so,\\nthough she had never mentioned it.\\n\\nOn the next Sunday morning J.W. drove out of town in time to get to the\\nlittle old church of his childhood for morning service. Then he would go\\nhome with the Shenks for dinner, spend the afternoon, get the books and\\ncome home when he was ready. There was no hurry. J.W., Sr., had given\\nhim two Sundays' leave of absence from Sunday school. The next Sunday\\nwould be his and Marty's, but this would be his and Jeannette's.\\n\\nNot that he needed to make any special plans for being with Jeannette\\nShenk; of late he had found the half hour drive down to the old farm the\\nprelude to a pleasant evening. Sometimes he would make the round trip\\ntwice, running out to bring Jeanette into town, when something was\\ngoing on, and taking her home afterward in the immemorial fashion.\\n\\nAs J.W. turned to the church yard lane leading up to the old horseshed,\\nhe noticed that there were only two cars there besides his own--and one\\nold-time sidebar buggy, battered and mud-bedaubed, with a decrepit and\\ndejected-looking gray mare between the shafts.\\n\\nIt was time for meeting, and he contrasted to-day's emptiness of the\\nlong sheds with the crowding vehicles of his childhood memories. In\\nthose days so tightly were buggies and surries and democrats, and even\\nspring wagons and an occasional sulky wedged into the space, that it was\\nnothing unusual for the sermon to be interrupted by an uproar in the\\nsheds, when some peevish horse attempted to set its teeth in the neck of\\na neighbor, with a resultant squealing and plunging, a cramping of\\nwheels and a rattle of harness which could neutralize the most\\nvociferous circuit rider's eloquence.\\n\\nAt the door, J.W. fell in with the little group of men, who, according\\nto ancient custom, had waited in the yard for the announcement of the\\nfirst hymn before ending their talk of crops and roads and stock, and\\njoining the women and children within.\\n\\nInside the contrast with the older day was even more striking. The\\nchurch, small as it was, seemed almost empty. The Shenks were there,\\nincluding Jeannette, as J.W. promptly managed to observe. Father Foltz\\nand his middle-aged daughter stood in their accustomed place; they had\\ncome in the venerable sidebar buggy, just as for two decades past.\\nMother Foltz hadn't been out of the house in years, and among J.W.'s\\nearliest recollections were those of the cottage prayer meetings that he\\nhad attended with his father in Mrs. Foltz's speckless sickroom. Then\\nthere were the four Newells, and Mrs. Bellamy, and Mr. and Mrs. Haggard\\nwith their two little girls, and a few people J.W. did not know--perhaps\\ntwenty-five altogether. No wonder the preacher was disheartened, and\\npreached a flavorless sermon.\\n\\nWhere were the boys and girls of even a dozen years ago? where the\\nchildren who began their Sunday school career in the little recess back\\nof the curtain? and where the whole families that once filled the place?\\nSurely, old Deep Creek Church had fallen on evil days.\\n\\nIt was a dismal service, with its dreary sermon and its tuneless hymns.\\nAfter the benediction J.W. shook hands with the preacher, whom he knew\\nslightly, and exchanged greetings with all the old friends.\\n\\n\\\"Well, John Wesley,\\\" said Father Foltz, with glum garrulity, \\\"this ain't\\nthe church you used to know when you was little. I mind in them times\\nwhen you folks lived on the farm how we thought we'd have to enlarge the\\nmeetinghouse. But it's a good thing we never done it. There's room\\nenough now,\\\" and the old man indulged in a mirthless, toothless grimace.\\n\\nThe Shenks didn't invite him to dinner; their understanding was finer\\nthan that. Pa Shenk just said, \\\"Let me drive out first, John Wesley;\\nI'll go on ahead and open the gate,\\\" And J.W. said to Jeannette, \\\"Jump\\ninto my car, Jean; it isn't fair to put everybody into Pa Shenk's Ford\\nwhen mine's younger and nearly empty.\\\"\\n\\nSo that was that; all regular and comfortable and proper. If Mrs. Newell\\nsmiled as she watched them drive away, what of it? She was heard to say\\nto Mrs. Bellamy, \\\"I've known for three years that those two ought to\\nwake up and fall in love with each other, and they've been slower than\\nFather Foltz's old gray mare. But it looks as though they were getting\\ntheir eyes open at last.\\\"\\n\\nAt the farm Mrs. Shenk hurried to finish up the dinner preparations,\\nwith Jeannette to help. Ben and little Alice contended for J.W.'s favor,\\nuntil he took Alice on his knee and put one arm about her and the other\\nabout her brother, standing by the chair. And Pa Shenk talked about the\\nchurch.\\n\\n\\\"I reckon I shouldn't complain, John Wesley,\\\" he said, \\\"seeing that our\\nMarty is a country preacher, and maybe he'll be having to handle a job\\nlike this some time. But I can't believe he will. His letters don't read\\nlike it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, Pa Shenk,\\\" said J.W., \\\"don't you suppose the trouble here in Deep\\nCreek is because you're so near town? Nine miles is nothing these days,\\nbut when you first came to the farm there was only one automobile in the\\ntownship. Now everybody can go into town to church.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They can, boy,\\\" Pa Shenk answered, \\\"but they don't. Not all of 'em.\\nSome don't care enough to go anywhere. One-year tenants, mostly, they\\nare. Some go to town, all right enough, but not to church. A few go to\\nchurch, I admit, but only a few.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. started to speak, hesitated, then blurted it out. \\\"Maybe dad and\\nothers like him are responsible for some of the trouble. They've pulled\\nout and left just a few to carry the load. You're all right, of course;\\nyou really belong here. But a lot of the farmers who have moved to town\\nhave rented their places to what you call one-year tenants, and it seems\\nto me that's a poor way to build up anything in the country, churches or\\nanything else. Tenants that are always moving don't get to know anybody\\nor to count for anything. It's not much wonder they are no use to the\\nchurch.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There's a good deal in that, John Wesley,\\\" said Pa Shenk. \\\"Your father\\nand me, we get along fine. We're more like partners than owner and\\ntenant. But it isn't so with these short-term renters. The owner raises\\nthe rent as the price of land rises, and the tenant is mostly too poor\\nto do anything much after he's paid the rent. Besides, he's got no stake\\nin the neighborhood. Why should he pay to help build a new church, when\\nhe's got to move the first of March? And the church has been as careless\\nabout him as he has been about the church.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's what bothers me,\\\" J.W. commented. \\\"But even so, I should think\\nsomething could be done to interest these folks. They've all got\\nfamilies to bring up.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Something can be done, too,\\\" said Pa Shenk. \\\"You remember when the\\npeople on upper Deep Creek used to come here to church, four miles or\\nso? Well, now they are going to Fairfield Church--owners, renters,\\neverybody. It's surprising how Fairfield Church is growing. That's going\\naway from town, not to it, and they're as near to town as we are.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then,\\\" persisted J.W., \\\"how do you account for it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Only one way, my boy,\\\" said Pa Shenk. \\\"I'm as much to blame as any, but\\nwe've had some preachers here that didn't seem to understand, and then\\nlately we've had preachers who stayed in town all the time except on\\npreaching Sunday, and we scarcely saw or heard of 'em all the two weeks\\nbetween. They haven't held protracted meetings for several years, and I\\nain't blaming 'em. What's the use of holding meetings when you know\\nnobody's coming except people that were converted before our present\\npastor was born?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You say some people are going over to Fairfield?\\\" asked J.W. \\\"Why do\\nthey go there, when they could go to town about as easy?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, John Wesley,\\\" Pa Shenk answered, soberly. \\\"I think I know. But\\nyou say you're going to spend next Sunday with Marty. From what Marty\\nwrites I've a notion it's much the same on his work as it is at\\nFairfield, except that Marty has two points. Wait till next week, and\\nthen come back and tell us how you explain the difference between Deep\\nCreek Church and Ellis.\\\"\\n\\nIn the afternoon Jeannette and J.W. took a ride around the\\nneighborhood, whose every tree and culvert and rural mail-box they knew,\\nwithout in the least being tired of seeing it. Their talk was on an old,\\nold subject, and not remarkable, yet somehow it was more to them both\\nthan any poet's rhapsody. And their occasional silences were no less\\neloquent.\\n\\nBut in a more than usually prosaic moment Jeannette said, \\\"John Wesley,\\nI wonder if there's any hope to get the Deep Creek young people\\ninterested in church the way they used to be? I'm just hungry for the\\nsort of good times the older boys and girls used to have when you and\\nMarty and I were nothing but children. They enjoyed themselves, and so\\ndid everybody else. What's the matter with so many country churches,\\nnowadays?\\\"\\n\\nTo which question J.W. could only answer: \\\"I don't know. I didn't\\nrealize things were so bad here. Maybe I'll get some ideas about it next\\nSaturday and Sunday. Your father seems to think Marty is getting started\\non the right track. And that reminds me; don't let me go away without\\nthose books he wants, will you?\\\"\\n\\nThis is not a record of that Sunday afternoon's drive, nor of the many\\nothers which followed on other Sundays and on the days between. Some\\nother time there may be opportunity for the whole story of Jeannette and\\nJ.W.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nAs J.W. drove up to Ellis Corners post office late the next Friday\\nafternoon Marty waylaid him and demanded to be taken aboard. \\\"Drive a\\nhalf-mile further east,\\\" he said after their boisterous greetings.\\n\\\"That's where we eat to-night--at Ambery's. Then just across the road to\\nthe church. We've got something special on.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A box supper,\\\" asked J.W., \\\"or a bean-bag party?\\\" But he knew better.\\n\\nMarty told him to wait and see. Supper was a pleasant meal, the Amberys\\nbeing pleasant people, who lived in a cozy new house. But J.W. was\\nmystified to hear Marty speak of Henry Ambery as a retired farmer. He\\nknew retired farmers in town, plenty of them, and some no happier for\\nbeing there. But in the country?\\n\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" said Marty, \\\"that's easy. Our church is the social hub of all this\\ncommunity, and I told the Amberys that if they built here they would be\\nas well off as in town. I'm right too. They bought two acres for less\\nthan the price of a town lot, and they have most of the farm comforts as\\nwell as all the modern conveniences. You didn't notice any signs of\\nhomesickness, did you?\\\"\\n\\nNo, J.W., hadn't, though he knew the retired-farmer sort of homesickness\\nwhen he saw it.\\n\\n\\\"And the Amberys are worth more to the church than they ever were,\\\"\\nMarty added. \\\"I'm thinking of a scheme to colonize two or three other\\nretiring farmers within easy reach of this church. Why not? They've got\\ncars, and can drive to the county seat in an hour if they want to.\\nThat's better than living there all the time, with nothing to do.\\\"\\n\\nBy this the two were at the church, a pretty frame building, L-shaped,\\nwith a community house adjoining the auditorium. People were beginning\\nto arrive in all sorts of vehicles--cars, mostly. J.W. looked for signs\\nof a feed, but vainly. No spread tables, no smell of cooking or rattle\\nof dishes from the kitchen.\\n\\n\\\"What is it, Marty?\\\" he asked. And Marty laughed as he answered,\\n\\\"Old-fashioned singing school, with some new-fashioned variations,\\nthat's all.\\\" Certainly it was something which interested the\\ncountryside, for there was every indication of a crowded house.\\n\\nJ.W. heard the singing and noted with high approval the variations which\\nmodernized the old order. He thought the idea plenty good enough even\\nfor Delafield, which, for him, left nothing more to be said. And there\\n_was_ a feed, after all; but it was distinctly light refreshments, such\\nas J.W. was used to at Delafield First Church.\\n\\nOn the way back to the Amberys', and well into the night in Marty's\\nroom, they talked about the circuit and its work.\\n\\n\\\"It isn't a circuit, rightly, you know,\\\" Marty said. \\\"I preach every\\nSunday at both places, and for the present\\\"--J.W. grinned--\\\"I can get\\nacross the whole parish every day if necessary. But I'm working it a\\nlittle more systematically than that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You must be. I can hardly believe even what I've seen already,\\\" J.W.\\nreplied. \\\"When I was at Deep Creek last Sunday I was sure it was all\\noff with the country church, and on the way down here I passed three\\nabandoned meetinghouses. So I made up my mind to persuade you out of it.\\nYou know I wasn't much in favor of your coming here in the first place.\\nBut maybe that's a bigger job than I thought.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You're right, John Wesley, about that. I don't budge, if I can make\\nmyself big enough for the job. It's too interesting. And things are\\nhappening. There's no danger of this church being abandoned.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But what do you do, Marty, to make things happen? I know they don't\\njust happen. I'm from the country too, remember that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do I do? Not 'I' but 'we.' Well, we work with our heads first, and\\nour hearts. Then we get out and go at it. Take our very first social\\ndifficulty; in Delafield you have a dozen places to go to. Here it's\\neither the church or the schoolhouse--that's all the choice there is.\\nAnd the schoolhouse has its limitations. So our folks have decided to\\nmake the church, both here and at Valencia, the center of the community.\\nThat explains the social hall; we call it 'Community House.' Everything\\nthat goes on, except the barn dances over east that we can't do much\\nwith so far, goes on in the church, or starts with the church, or ends\\nat the church. That's the first scheme we put over. It was fairly easy,\\nyou know, because all our country people are pretty much one lot. We\\nhave no rich, and no really poor. And they're not organized to death,\\neither, as you are in Delafield.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you try to have something going on every night, and nearly every\\nday, as Brother Drury does with us?\\\" J.W. asked.\\n\\n\\\"Not quite,\\\" replied Marty; \\\"we can't. We're too busy growing the food\\nfor you town folks. But we keep up a pretty stiff pace, for the\\npreacher; I have no time hanging on my hands.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should think not,\\\" J.W. commented, \\\"if you try to run everything.\\nMr. Drury always seems to have lots of time, just because he makes the\\nrest of us run the works in Delafield First.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, he does, does he?\\\" said Marty, shortly, who knew something of the\\nolder minister's strategy. \\\"That's according to how you look at it. I'm\\nnot above learning from him, and I don't run everything, either. But I'm\\nthere, or thereabouts, most of the time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How do you get time for your study and your sermons, then,\\\" queried J.\\nW., \\\"if you're on the go so much?\\\"\\n\\nMarty turned a quizzical look at J.W. \\\"My beloved chum, how did you and\\nI get time for our studies at Cartwright?\\\" he said. \\\"Besides, I'm making\\none hand wash the other. The social life here, for instance, used to be\\npretty bad, before Henderson came--that's the preacher whose place I\\ntook. It was pulling away from the church; now it draws to the church.\\nHenderson started that. The people who are my main dependence in the\\nother affairs are mostly the same people I can count on in the Sunday\\nschool and League and the preaching service. The more we do the better\\nit is for what we do Sundays.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then, there's another Because these people and I know one another so\\nwell, I couldn't put on airs in the pulpit if I wanted to. I've just got\\nto preach straight, and I won't preach a thing I can't back up myself. I\\nuse country illustrations; show them their own world. It's one big white\\nmark for the Farwell farm, as you might suppose, that I know the best\\nside of country life, though I don't advertise your real estate.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know,\\\" said J.W. \\\"But don't you find country people pretty hard to\\nmanage? That's our experience at the store. They are particular and\\ncritical, and think they know just what they want.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They do too,\\\" Marty asserted, \\\"Why shouldn't they? I believe I can tell\\nyou one big difference between the city boy and the country. You've been\\nboth; see if I'm right. The country boy minds his folks, and his\\nteacher. But everything else minds him. He is boss of every critter on\\nthe place, from the hens to the horses, whenever he has anything to do\\nwith them at all. So he learns to think for them, as well as for\\nhimself. In the city the boy has no chance to give orders--he's under\\norders, all the time; the traffic cop, the truant officer, the boss in\\nthe shop or the office, the street car conductor, the janitor--everybody\\nbosses him and he bosses nothing, except his kid brothers and sisters.\\nSo he may come to be half cringer and half bully. The country boy is not\\nlikely to be much afraid, and he soon learns that if he tries to boss\\neven the boys without good reason it doesn't pay. Maybe that's the\\nreason so many country boys make good when they go to the city.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And the reason why a city boy like me,\\\" suggested J.W., \\\"would be a\\nmisfit in the country.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, you,\\\" scoffed Marty. \\\"You don't count. You're a half-breed. But, as\\nI meant to say, you're right about country folks. They are a little\\nclose, maybe. They are more independent in their business than town\\npeople, but they learn how to work together; they exchange farm work,\\nand work the roads, and they are fairly dependent on one another for all\\nsocial life.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"On Deep Creek the tenant farmers are the biggest difficulty, your dad\\ntold me last Sunday,\\\" said J.W. \\\"They go to town when they go anywhere,\\nand not to church, either.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know,\\\" said Marty. \\\"And I don't much blame 'em, from all I hear. But\\nHenderson changed that considerably in this community. He found out that\\nthe tenants were just as human as the others, only they had the idea\\nthat nobody cared about them, because they might be here to-day and gone\\nto-morrow. And, what do you think? I find tenant farmers around here are\\nbeginning to take longer leases; one or two are about like dad's been\\nwith your father--more partners than anything else. Every renter family\\nin this neighborhood comes to our church, and only three or four fight\\nshy of us at Valencia.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All right,\\\" said J.W., drowsily. \\\"Go to sleep now; I've got to inspect\\nthat Holstein hotel in the morning, and I know what country hours are.\\\"\\n\\nThe next day J.W. drove off toward the big barns of his customer, and\\nleft Marty deep in the mysteries of Sunday's sermon. Marty was yet a\\nvery young preacher, and one sermon a week was all he could manage, as\\nseveral of his admirers had found out to his discomfiture, when one\\nSunday they followed him from Ellis in the morning to Valencia at night.\\nBut the \\\"twicers\\\" professed to enjoy it.\\n\\nJ.W.'s farmer was quite ready to talk about the new barn equipment and\\nhow it was working, and he had remarkably few complaints, these more for\\nform's sake than anything else. That business was soon out of the way.\\n\\nBut Farmer Bellamy was interested in other things besides ventilators\\nand horse-forks.\\n\\n\\\"So you're a friend of our preacher,\\\" he said, in the questioning\\naffirmative of the deliberate country. \\\"Well, he's quite a go-ahead\\nyoung fellow; you never get up early enough to find him working in a\\ncold collar. Maybe he's a mite ambitious, but I don't know.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W., as always, came promptly to Marty's defense. \\\"He's not ambitious\\nfor himself, Mr. Bellamy; I'll vouch for that. But I shouldn't wonder he\\nis ambitious about his work, and maybe that's not a bad thing for a\\ncountry preacher in these days.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's so,\\\" Mr. Bellamy assented. \\\"But I doubt we keep him. He'll be\\ngetting a church in town before long.\\\"\\n\\nNow J.W. had no instructions from Marty, but he thought he might\\nventure. And he had been introduced to a few ideas that he had never met\\nin the days when he objected to Marty's taking a country circuit.\\n\\n\\\"I'll tell you something, Mr. Bellamy,\\\" he said. \\\"Marty is a farmer's\\nboy who loves the country. If he has the right sort of backing, I\\nshouldn't wonder he stayed here a good long time. He's got enough plans\\nahead for this circuit of his.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Bellamy laughed. \\\"He has that; if he waits to get 'em all going\\nwe're sure of him for a while. Why, he wants to make the church the most\\nimportant business in the whole neighborhood; and, what's more, he's\\ngetting some of us to see it that way too.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I guess that's his dream,\\\" J.W. said. \\\"And it's so much better\\nthan the reality up around where I used to live that I wouldn't head him\\noff if I were you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Head him off!\\\" Mr. Bellamy laughed again. \\\"Why, do you know what he did\\nin the fall, when some of us told him we couldn't do much for missions?\\nHe phoned all over the neighborhood the day before he set out with a\\nton-and-a-half truck he had hired for the job. Told us to put into the\\ntruck anything we could spare. And what do you think? Before night he\\ndrove into Hill City with a big overload, even for that truck, of wheat,\\ncorn, butter, eggs, chickens, sausage, apples, potatoes, and dear knows\\nwhat. Sold the lot for sixty-nine dollars. He paid nine dollars for the\\ntruck--got a rate on it--and turned in for missions sixty dollars. We've\\nnever given more than twenty, in cash.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But that wasn't all. Next Sunday he reported, and before any of us\\ncould say 'Praise the Lord!' says he, 'Don't think the Lord's giving any\\nof us much credit for that stuff. We owe him a good deal more than a few\\neggs that we'll never miss. I just wanted to show you that when we\\ncountry people really start paying our tithe to the Almighty our\\nmissionary and other offerings will make that truckload look like the\\ncrumbs from our tables. I've proved that we're rich, instead of being\\ntoo poor to provide for missions. And it's all our Father's, you know.\\nWhen we pay him our tithe we admit that in the only practical way,'\\nFunny thing was the whole business had been so queer, nobody got mad\\nover his plain talk. Some of us have begun to tithe, and to enjoy it.\\nYes; that young feller is quite a go-ahead young feller.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. rather admired the tale of the truck; it was like Marty, right\\nenough, to get his tithing talk illustrated with a load of produce; but\\nthere was more than a hint of a new Marty, with a new directness and\\nconfidence.\\n\\nSo he asked, \\\"What else is he doing that's making a difference?\\\"\\n\\nAnd the floodgates were lifted. The Bellamy gift of utterance had a\\ncongenial theme. For an hour the stream ran strong and steady, and when\\nit would have stopped none could tell. But J.W. remembered he had\\npromised to be back with Marty for dinner, and so, in the midst of a\\nstory about Marty's Saturday afternoon outings with the boys, highly\\nreminiscent of their own old-time Saturdays in the Deep Creek timber,\\nJ.W. made his excuses and hurried away.\\n\\nIn that hour he had heard of the observing of special days, Thanksgiving\\nand Christmas particularly; of the rage for athletic equipment on every\\nfarm which had youngsters, so that the usual anaemic croquet outfit had\\ngiven place to basketball practice sets, indoor-outdoor ball,\\nvolley-ball nets, and other paraphernalia. Some of it not much used now,\\nsince winter had come, but under Marty's leadership, a skating rink\\nconstruction gang had thrown up a dirt embankment in a low spot near the\\ncreek and then cut a channel far enough upstream to flood about four\\nacres of swamp. Mr. Bellamy told about the skating tournaments every\\nafternoon of the cold weather for the school children, and Saturday\\nafternoons for the older young folks. More people went than skated too,\\nthe garrulous farmer asserted. It was just another of that young\\npreacher's sociability schemes, and there was no end to 'em, seemed like\\nto him.\\n\\nThere was even more on the business side of country life: how Marty had\\njoined forces with the Grange and the county agent and the cooperators\\nof the creamery and the elevator and the school teachers. And so on, and\\nso on.\\n\\nJ.W. would be the last to worry about such a program; it just fitted\\nhis ideas. But it made him a little more interested in the Sunday\\nservices. Would Marty's preaching match his community work?\\n\\nBut before Sunday morning came J.W. had other questions to ask. He put\\nthem to Marty in intervals of the skating races; and again after supper,\\nbefore going over to the church to meet a little group of Sunday-school\\nfolk--\\\"my teacher-partners\\\" Marty called them--who were learning with\\nhim how to adapt Sunday school science and the teaching art to the\\nconditions of the open country.\\n\\nAll of J.W.'s questions were really one big question: \\\"Say, Marty, boy,\\nI always knew you had something in you that didn't show on the surface,\\nbut I never thought it was exactly the stuff they need to make\\nup-to-date country preachers. How does it happen that you've blossomed\\nout in these few months as a Moses to lead a 'rural parish'--if that's\\nthe right scientific name--out of such a wilderness as I saw at Deep\\nCreek last Sunday?\\\"\\n\\nMarty made a pass at his chum in the fashion of the Cartwright days, and\\nwaited for the return punch before answering. \\\"Don't you 'Moses' me,\\nJohn Wesley. Besides, this circuit was no wilderness. Henderson, the\\npreacher who was here before me, was just the man for this work. He knew\\nthe country, and believed it had the makings of even more attractive\\nlife than the town. Too bad he had to quit. But he started these folks\\nthinking the right way. And then, don't you remember I wrote last\\nsummer that I was spending two weeks at a school for rural ministers?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, I remember that,\\\" J.W. answered, \\\"but that's no explanation. I\\nspent four years at a college for town and country boys, and now look at\\nme! Two weeks is a little too short a course to produce miracles, even\\nwith such an intellect as yours, notwithstanding your name is bigger\\nthan mine, Martin Luther! Now, if you'd said four weeks, I might almost\\nhave believed you, but two weeks--well, it just isn't done, that's all!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Make fun of it, will you!\\\" said Marty, with another short-arm jab.\\n\\\"Now, listen to me. That thing is simple enough. First off, I'd been\\nthinking four years about being a preacher. On top of that, I'd been a\\ncountry boy for twenty-three years. I know the Deep Creek neighborhood\\nbetter than you do, because I had to live there. You were just visiting\\nthe farm your father paid taxes on. When I came here I found that\\nHenderson had set things going. He told me what his dream was. So, when\\nI went to that two-weeks' school I was ready to take in every word and\\nsee every picture and get a grip on every principle. Maybe you don't\\nknow that it was one of many such schools set up by the rural work\\nleaders of our Home Missions Board, and it was a great school. They had\\nno use for rocking-chair ruralists, so the faculty, instead of being\\nmade up of paper experts, was a bunch of men who _knew_. It was worth a\\nyear of dawdling over text-books. You see, I knew I could come back here\\nand try everything on my own people. It was like the Squeers school in\\n'Nicholas Nickleby,' 'Member? When the spelling class was up, Squeers\\nsays to Smike, the big, helpless dunce, 'Spell window,'\\\" And Smike says,\\n'W-i-n-d-e-r,' 'All right,' Squeers says, 'now go out and wash 'em,'\\nWell, I hope I got the spelling a little nearer right, but I came home\\nand began washing my windows. That's all.\\n\\nJ.W. said \\\"Huh!\\\" and that stood for understanding, and approval, and\\nconfidence.\\n\\nAs to Marty's preaching, it was a boy's preaching, naturally, but it was\\npreaching. And the people came for it; J.W., remarked to himself the\\ncontrast between the close-parked cars around Ellis church and the\\nforlornly vacant horse-sheds he had seen at Deep Creek the Sunday\\nbefore.\\n\\nThe hearty singing of people glad to be singing together, the contagious\\ninterest of a well-filled house, and the simple directness of the\\npreacher were all of a piece. Here was no effort to ape the forms of a\\ncathedral, but neither was there any careless, cheap slovenliness. And\\nassuredly there were no religious \\\"stunts.\\\"\\n\\nMarty preached the Christian evangel, not moralized agriculture. He made\\nthe gospel invitation a social appeal, without blinking its primary\\nmessage to the individual to place himself under the authority of\\nChrist's self-forgetting love. He put first things in front--\\\"Him that\\ncometh unto me,\\\" and then with simple illustrations and words as simple\\nhe showed that they who had accepted Christ's lordship were honor bound\\nto live together under a new sort of law from that of the restless,\\npushing, self-centered world: \\\"It shall not be so among you.\\\" Besides,\\nhe told them they could not separate service from profit. They knew, for\\ninstance, that their farm values were a third higher because of the\\npresence of the church and its work, but they would find that the profit\\nmotive was not big enough to keep the church going. They had to love the\\nwork, and do it for love of it.\\n\\nThat afternoon the friends drove over to Valencia, where at night Marty\\nwould preach again this his one sermon of the week; and J.W. left him\\nthere, turning his car homeward for the fifty-two miles to Delafield.\\n\\nAs they parted, J.W. gripped Marty's hand and said: \\\"Old man, I own up.\\nI thought you ought not to bury yourself in the country, but I had no\\nneed to worry. I know preachers who are buried in town all right; you\\nhave a bigger field and a livelier one than they will ever find. And\\nI'll never say another word about your two-weeks' school. If the Home\\nMissions Board had nothing else to do, such work as it showed you how to\\ndo would be worth all the Board costs. I'm going to make trouble for Mr.\\nDrury and the district superintendent and the bishop and the Board and\\nanybody else I can get hold of, until Deep Creek gets the same sort of\\nchance as this circuit of yours. If only they knew where to find another\\nMartin Luther Shenk--that's the rub!\\\" And with a last handclasp the\\nchums went their separate ways.\\n\\nOn Monday J.W. called up Pastor Drury and gave that gentleman, who was\\nexpecting it, a five-minute summary of his day with Marty. \\\"I'm awfully\\nglad I happened to think of going over there,\\\" he said, \\\"not only for\\nthe sake of being with the old boy again, but because I've got some new\\nnotions about the country church, and about what we Methodists are\\nbeginning to do for the places where Methodism got its start.\\\"\\n\\nAnd Walter Drury said, \\\"Yes, I'm glad, too.\\\" So he was; he could put\\ndown a new mark on the credit side of the Experiment.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\n\\n\\\"IS HE NOT A MAN AND A BROTHER?\\\"\\n\\nThe colored Methodists of Delafield, who called their church \\\"Saint\\nMarks,\\\" had always been on good terms with their white co-religionists.\\nMr. Drury and the pastor of Saint Marks found many occasions of helping\\neach other in their work. The single way in which these two showed\\nthemselves conscious of the color line was that while the pastor of\\nFirst Church often \\\"preached\\\" in Saint Marks, when the pastor of Saint\\nMarks appeared in the pulpit of First Church, it was \\\"to speak on some\\naspect of his work.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. knew Saint Marks of old. In his high-school days that church had\\nfor its preacher one of a fast-vanishing race, a man mighty in\\nexhortation, even though narrowly circumscribed in scholastic equipment.\\nHis preaching was redolent of the camp meeting, and he counted that\\nsermon lost which did not evoke a shout or two from the front benches.\\n\\nA few of First Church's younger people often went to sing at Saint Marks\\non special occasions, and went all the more cheerfully because of the\\nchance it afforded to hear Brother King Officer preach. Where he got\\nthat name is not known, but he had no other.\\n\\nDo not think the young people either went to scoff or remained to pray.\\nIf at times they were amused at Brother Officer's peculiarities, so\\nwere some members of his own flock, and Brother Officer was wise enough\\nto assume that no disrespect was intended. And if the white visitors\\ntreated his fervent appeals to the unconverted and backsliders as part\\nof the program, but having no slightest application to them, this was\\nalso the regular thing, and nobody was troubled thereat.\\n\\nBut while J.W. was away at college a new pastor had come to Saint Marks,\\na college and seminary graduate. And he had come just in time. Brother\\nOfficer was getting old, but the determining factor which made the\\nchange necessary was that Delafield happened to be near one of the\\ngeneral routes by which thousands of colored people were moving\\nnorthward. \\\"Exoduses\\\" have been before; Kansas still remembers the\\nexodus from Tennessee of forty years ago; but this latest exodus had no\\none starting-point nor any single destination. It was a vast shifting of\\nNegro populations from below Mason and Dixon's line, and it swept\\nnorthward toward all the great industrial centers. Its cause and\\nconsequences make a remarkable story, for which there is no room in this\\nchronicle.\\n\\nDelafield thought it could not absorb many more Negroes, but before the\\nexodus movement subsided the stragglers who had turned aside at\\nDelafield had more than doubled the Negro population of the town.\\n\\nA heavy burden of new responsibility was on the young pastor of Saint\\nMarks. The newcomers had no such alertness and resourcefulness as his\\nown people. They were helpless in the face of new experiences. Soon\\nthey became a worry and an enigma to the town authorities; but\\nespecially and inevitably they turned to the churches of their own\\ncolor, of which Delafield could boast but two, a Methodist and a\\nBaptist. So Saint Marks and its pastor found both new opportunity and\\nnew troubles.\\n\\nOne day in the early spring Mr. Drury dropped in to the Farwell store\\nand asked J.W. if he would be busy that night. The road to Deep Creek\\nwas at its spring worst, and J.W. had nothing special on. He said as\\nmuch, and answering his look of inquiry the pastor said, \\\"There's a man\\nspeaking at Saint Marks to-night who's a Yale graduate and a Negro. He's\\nalso a Methodist. Does the combination interest you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, yes,\\\" J.W. answered, \\\"it might. You know I used to go with the\\nbunch to Saint Marks when Brother Officer was pastor, but I haven't been\\nsince he left. I'd like to see what the new preacher is doing, and it\\nought to be worth something to hear a Negro alumnus of Yale.\\\"\\n\\nWilliam Hightower, it seemed, was the speaker's name--a strong-voiced;\\nconfident man in his thirties. As J.W., soon discovered, Hightower was a\\ndistinctively modern Negro. Where King Officer had been almost cringing,\\nHightower's thought, however diplomatically spoken, was that of an\\nup-standing mind; where Officer accepted as part of the social order the\\ncolored man's dependence on the white, Hightower spoke of something he\\ncalled racial solidarity. It was plain that he meant his Negro hearers\\nto make much of the Negro's capacity for self-direction.\\n\\nThere was little bitterness and no radicalism in the speech, but to J.W.\\nit had a queer, new note. He said as much to Mr. Drury, on the way home.\\n\\\"Why, that Hightower hardly ever mentioned the church, although he was\\nspeaking at a church meeting. And how independent he was!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So you noticed that, did you?\\\" the pastor responded. \\\"To me it is one\\nof the signs of a new day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But do you think it is a good day, Mr. Drury?\\\" queried J.W.\\n\\n\\\"Yes--perhaps; I don't know. Anyhow, it is new, and some of the blame\\nfor it is on our shoulders. The way the Negro thinks and feels to-day is\\na striking proof of the fact, often forgotten, that when you settle old\\nquestions you raise new ones.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maybe,\\\" said J.W. doubtfully, \\\"but I didn't know we had settled the\\nNegro question.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nor I,\\\" agreed Mr. Drury. \\\"What we--I mean, we Methodists--settled when\\nwe began to deal with the Negro right after emancipation was not the\\nrace question. It was not even a missionary question, in the old sense,\\nbut it was the question of the nature of the education we should give\\nthe young colored people. For we set out deliberately to give them\\nschooling first, with evangelism as an accompaniment. The stress was on\\neducation, and we decided at the outset on a certain sort of education.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should think,\\\" ventured J.W., \\\"that any old sort of education would\\nserve; the first teachers had to begin at the bottom, didn't they?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and lower than any beginnings you know anything about,\\\" the pastor\\nreplied. \\\"Our first workers began without equipment, without\\nencouragement, and without everything else except a great pity for the\\nfreedman. Did you notice, by the way, that the speaker to-night never\\nsaid 'freedman' or mentioned slavery? It is a new day, I tell you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wish you'd explain just what you mean by that, Mr. Drury,\\\" J.W. said.\\n\\\"I don't seem to get it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I mean,\\\" said Mr. Drury, \\\"that as soon as our church had decided to do\\nsomething for the emancipated slaves, it began to work out a scheme of\\nNegro education. That was before Tuskegee, and even before Hampton\\nInstitute. Maybe we never thought of the Booker Washington idea, or\\npurely industrial education, but at any rate we went on the theory that\\nthe Negro deserved and in time could take as good an education as any\\nother American. So we started academies and colleges and even\\nuniversities for him, and a medical school and a theological seminary.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can see myself that there's a difference between that and the\\nindustrial idea,\\\" said J.W.\\n\\n\\\"Decidedly, there is,\\\" answered the minister; \\\"all the difference which\\nhas helped to bring this new day I'm talking about, and to produce such\\nNegro leaders as William Hightower. You see, J.W., it's this way: Booker\\nWashington believed that after the Negro had been taught to read and\\nwrite and cipher, his next and greatest educational need was to learn\\nto make a living.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, what's the matter with that?\\\" retorted J.W. \\\"Seems to me it's\\ncommon sense.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Possibly,\\\" Mr. Drury answered, dryly. \\\"But what would you say was the\\nfirst thing needed in the fight against the almost total illiteracy of\\nthe freedmen?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, teachers, I suppose,\\\" said J.W. \\\"And it would sure take a lot of\\nteachers, even to make a start.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Drury said, \\\"That's exactly the fact. It has called for so many that\\nto this day there isn't anything like enough teachers, although some of\\nour schools and those of other churches have been at work for fifty\\nyears. And, remember, that practically all of these teachers, except in\\na few advanced schools, must be black teachers, themselves brought up\\nout of ignorance.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said J.W., \\\"that's my point. The quicker we could teach the\\nteachers, the sooner they would be ready to teach others.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is to say,\\\" Mr. Drury interpreted, \\\"the less we taught them, the\\nbetter? Seems to me I heard something of a small revolt in your time at\\nCartwright because it seemed necessary that a young tutor should be\\ntemporarily assigned to the class in sophomore English.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. chuckled. \\\"It was my class. Why, that fellow was never more than\\ntwo jumps ahead of the daily work. We knew he had to study his own\\nlesson assignments before he could hear a recitation. We weren't\\ngetting anything out of it except the bare text. So some of the boys\\nmade things lively for a few days, and he asked to be relieved.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Quite so. Your class had every imaginable advantage over the colored\\nboys and girls in our schools--just one teacher below par. And yet you\\nthink it would be all right to have all colored teachers no more than\\ntwo jumps ahead of their pupils.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, yes, I see,\\\" J.W. said, with a touch of thoughtfulness. \\\"I\\nsuppose a good teacher needs more than the minimum text-book knowledge.\\nIs that the Methodist theory?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now you're talking like yourself,\\\" Mr. Drury told him. \\\"Yes, that's the\\nMethodist theory. For the fifty years of the old Freedmen's Aid\\nSociety--now the Board of Education for Negroes--it has run these\\nschools, eighteen of them now, with five thousand seven hundred and two\\nearnest students enrolled, on a double theory. The first part of the\\ntheory is that every child--black, white, red or yellow--ought to have\\nall the education he can use. Anything less than that would be as good\\nas saying that America cares to develop its human resources only just so\\nfar, and not to the limit. The other part of the theory is that the last\\nperson in the world to be put off with half an education is a preacher\\nor a teacher. The best is just good enough for all teachers, whether\\nthey teach from a desk or from a pulpit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I guess that's so too,\\\" said J.W. \\\"You're getting me interested. Now go\\non and tell me some more.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The new pastor of Saint Marks told me,\\\" said Mr. Drury, irrelevantly,\\n\\\"that they would be wanting some new roofing for the barn they're\\nturning into a community house. I shouldn't be surprised if you sold the\\nchurch a nice little bill of goods. And while you are at it, you might\\ntalk to the pastor--Driver's his name--about this thing from his side of\\nthe road. He knows more than I do.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. said he would. And, though he would have meant it in any case, the\\nhint about roofing made certain that \\\"Elder\\\" Driver would have a call in\\nthe morning from a rising young hardware salesman.\\n\\nBy this time they were at the Farwell gate, and J.W. said goodnight. Mr.\\nDrury walked home, but before he got ready for his beloved last hour of\\nthe day, with its easy chair and its cherished book, he called up his\\ncolored colleague, and they had a brief talk over the 'phone.\\n\\nNow, Walter Drury had taken no one into his confidence about the\\nExperiment, nor did he intend to; he had the best of reasons for keeping\\nhis own counsel, through the years. So Elder Driver could not know the\\ntrue inwardness of this telephone call; indeed, it was so casual that he\\ndid not even think to mention it to J.W. when that alert roofing\\nspecialist turned up next morning.\\n\\n\\\"I heard you were going to put new roofing on that barn you are fixing\\nup, Mr. Driver, and I thought I might get your order for the job. Maybe\\nyou know that we do a good deal of that sort of work, and we can give\\nyou expert service; the right roofing put on to stay, and to stay put.\\\"\\n\\nYes, they were thinking of that roof; had to, because it leaked like a\\nmarket basket, and they needed the place right now, what with the many\\ncolored Methodists who had come to town and had no home--only rooms in\\nthe little houses of the colored settlement that had been too small for\\ncomfort even before the exodus. But the place would be worth a lot to\\ntheir work when they got it.\\n\\n\\\"About how much do you think of spending, Mr. Driver?\\\" J.W. asked.\\nKnowing the limited means of Saint Marks, he expected to supply the\\ncheapest roofing the Farwell Hardware Company had in stock, but Pastor\\nDriver had a surprise for him.\\n\\n\\\"Why,\\\" he said, \\\"we want the best there is. That building was a barn,\\nI'll admit, but it is strongly built, and we expect to fix it pretty\\nthoroughly. We have a gift from the Board of Home Missions and Church\\nExtension, and we match that with as much again of our own money, enough\\nin all to swing the building around off the alley, put it on a new\\nfoundation next to the church, and remodel it for our needs.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's news to me,\\\" said J.W., \\\"though of course I'm glad to hear it.\\nBut I didn't know that the Board put money into such work as this.\\nSomehow I supposed you were under the Board of Education for Negroes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, not for this sort of church work,\\\" the colored pastor answered. \\\"I\\nwas 'under' the Board of Education for Negroes, as you put it, for a\\nlong time myself, in the days when it was called the Freedmen's Aid\\nSociety. And so was my wife. But now we're doing missionary work, and\\nthat's the other Board's job.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes,\\\" J.W. assented. \\\"I might have known that. And you mean that\\nyou were under the Freedmen's Aid Society when you were going to\\nschool--is that it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's it,\\\" said Pastor Driver, with a gleaming smile. \\\"I was in two of\\nthe schools. Philander Smith College, at Little Rock, Arkansas, and\\nClark University, at Atlanta, Georgia. Then I got my theological course\\nat Gammon, on the same campus as Clark.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You say your wife was in school too?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes\\\"--with an even brighter smile--\\\"she was at Clark when I met her.\\nLike me, she attended two schools on that campus. The other was Thayer\\nHome, a girls' dormitory, supported by the Woman's Home Missionary\\nSociety.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A home? Then how could it be a school?\\\" J.W. asked.\\n\\n\\\"That's just it, Mr. Farwell,\\\" the minister explained. \\\"It was a school\\nof home life, not only cooking and sewing and scrubbing, and what all\\nyou think of as domestic science, but a school of the home spirit--just\\nthe thing my people need. Thayer was, and is, a place where the girl\\nstudents of Clark University learn how to make real homes. And in the\\ncollege classes they learn what you might suppose any college student\\nwould learn. That's why I said Mrs. Driver went to two schools.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. recalled the Hightower speech of the night before, and the\\ndiscussion with Mr. Drury on the way home. He wanted to go into it all\\nwith this pastor, who wasn't much past his own age, and evidently had\\nsome ideas. For the first time he wondered too how it happened that in\\nthat draft of the Everyday Doctrines of Delafield they had altogether\\nignored the Negro. Was that a symptom of something? Then he remembered\\nhis errand, and the work which was waiting up at the store.\\n\\nSo he said: \\\"Excuse me, Mr. Driver, for being so inquisitive. I've never\\nthought much about our church's colored work, but what I heard at last\\nnight's meeting started me. Rather curious that I should be here talking\\nabout it with you the very next morning, isn't it? But about that\\nroofing, now. Of course you'll look around and get other estimates, but\\nanyway I'd be glad to take the measurements and give you our figures. I\\npromise you they'll be worth considering.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm sure of that, Mr. Farwell,\\\" said the other, heartily, \\\"and if I\\nhave any influence with the committee--and I think I have--you needn't\\nlose any sleep over any other figures we might get. As for being\\ninquisitive about our work here, I wish more of this town's white\\nMethodists would get inquisitive. And that reminds me: there's to be an\\nEpworth League convention here week after next, and I've been told to\\ninvite one of the League leaders in your church to make a short address\\non the opening night. You're a League leader, I know, and the first one\\nI've thought about. So I'm asking you, right now. Will you come over and\\nspeak for us?\\\"\\n\\nNow, though J.W. always said he was no speaker, he had never hesitated\\nto accept invitations to take part in League conventions. But this was\\ndifferent. He made no answer for a minute. And in the pause his mind was\\nbusy with all he knew, and all he had acquired at second hand, about the\\nrelations of colored Christians and white, and particularly about what\\nmight be thought and said if it should be announced that he was to speak\\nat a Negro Epworth League convention. And then he had the grace to\\nblush, realizing that this colored pastor, waiting so quietly for his\\nanswer, must infallibly have followed his thoughts. In his swift\\nself-blame he felt that the least amends he could make for his unspoken\\ndiscourtesy was a prompt acceptance of the invitation.\\n\\nSo he looked up and said, hurriedly: \\\"Mr. Driver, forgive me for not\\nspeaking sooner. I'll do the best I can\\\"; and then, regaining his\\ncomposure, \\\"Have you any idea as to the subject I'm supposed to talk\\nabout?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" the colored minister replied, not without a touch of curious\\ntenseness in his voice. \\\"The committee wanted me to get a representative\\nfrom your Chapter to make a ten-minute address of welcome on behalf of\\nthe Epworthians of First Church!\\\"\\n\\nAgain J.W. was forced to hesitate. Here he was an Epworthian, but\\nknowing nothing at all about the work of these other young Methodists.\\nUntil to-day he scarcely knew they existed. And now he was asked to\\nwelcome them to town in the name of the League!\\n\\nBut once again shame compelled him to take the bold course. With an\\napologetic smile he said, \\\"Well, that's the last subject I could imagine\\nyou'd give to any of us at First Church. Your young people and ours have\\nhardly been aware of each other, and it seems queer that you should ask\\nme to make an address of welcome in your church. But as I think of it,\\nmaybe this is just what somebody ought to do, and I might as well try\\nit. Trouble is, what am I going to say?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We'll risk that, Mr. Farwell,\\\" said Pastor Driver, confidently. \\\"Just\\nsay what you think, and you'll do all right.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. was by no means sure of that, and the more he thought about his\\nspeech in the next few days, the more confused he became. Any ordinary\\nspeech of welcome would be easy--\\\"Glad you were sensible enough to come\\nto Delafield,\\\" \\\"make yourselves at home,\\\" \\\"freedom of the city,\\\" \\\"our\\nlatch strings are out,\\\" \\\"command us for anything we can do,\\\"\\n\\\"congratulate you on the fine work you are doing,\\\" \\\"know when we return\\nthis visit and come to the places you represent you will make us\\nwelcome\\\"--and so on. But it was plainly impossible for him to talk like\\nthat. It wouldn't be true, and it would certainly not be prudent.\\n\\nHe put the thing up to J.W., Sr. \\\"What'll I say, dad?\\\" he asked. \\\"You\\nknow we haven't had much to do with the people of Saint Marks, and maybe\\nit wouldn't be best for us to make any sudden change as to that, even\\nif some of us wanted to. But I've got to talk like a Christian, whether\\nI feel like one or not.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My son,\\\" his father answered him, sententiously, \\\"it's your speech, not\\nmine. But if an old fogy may suggest something, why not forget all about\\nthe usual sort of welcome address? Why not say something of the whole\\nprogram of our church as it affects our colored people? It touches the\\nyoung folks more than any others. Welcome them to that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's all very fine,\\\" J.W. objected. \\\"Everybody who's on for an\\naddress of welcome is advised by his friends to cut out the old stuff,\\nbut it means work. And you know that I don't know the first thing about\\nwhat you call the whole program of our church for the colored people.\\nThat man Driver knows, but I can't ask him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course not,\\\" assented J.W., Sr., \\\"but you can ask somebody else.\\nI'll venture Mr. Drury can tell you where to find all you would want to\\ntalk about. Ask him. You're never bothered by bashfulness with him, if I\\nremember right.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. admitted he had already thought of that. \\\"He and I were talking\\nabout this very thing the night before I went to see about that roofing.\\nBut here's the point--I'm not to represent the pastor, but the young\\npeople. And I'm not so sure that what Mr. Drury might give me, if he\\nwere willing, could be made to fit into a League speech, under the\\ncircumstances.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'd try it anyway,\\\" said the elder Farwell. \\\"He's nearly always\\nwilling, seems to me, and a pretty safe adviser most of the time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All right,\\\" agreed J.W., \\\"I'll see him, but he'll probably tell me to\\nfind things out for myself. He's a good scout, is Mr. Drury; the best\\npastor I ever knew or want to know, but sometimes he has the queerest\\nstreaks; won't help a fellow a little bit, and when you're absolutely\\nsure he could if he would. It won't be enough to see him, though; even\\nif he is in a generous mood and gives me more dope than I can use. I'd\\nbetter talk to some of the League people.\\\" And still he gravitated\\ntoward the pastor's study. It was the easiest way.\\n\\nThe pastor was always in a more generous mood than J.W. gave him credit\\nfor. It was only that he never supplied crutches when people needed to\\nuse their legs, nor brains when they needed to use their heads, nor\\nemotions when they needed to use their hearts.\\n\\nHe told J.W. to rummage through the one bookshelf in the study which\\nheld his small but usable collection of books and pamphlets on the\\nNegro, and see what he might find. And, as always, they talked.\\n\\n\\\"I can tell by that preacher at Saint Marks,\\\" said J.W., \\\"how I had the\\nwrong end of the argument that night we came from Hightower's address. A\\nman with a big job like his has to be a pretty big man, and he needs all\\nthe education he can get.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There's a principle in that, J.W.,\\\" suggested Mr. Drury; \\\"see if this\\nseems a reasonable way to state it: In dealing with any people, the\\nmore needy they are, the better equipped and trained their leaders\\nshould be.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, sir, it sounds reasonable enough,\\\" J.W. admitted. \\\"And yet I never\\nthought of it until now. But you said something the other night that I\\ndon't see yet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That may be no fault of yours, my boy,\\\" said the minister, with a\\nlaugh. \\\"What was it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, you said men like Hightower are inclined to overlook the work of\\nthe church, and that it was the church's own fault; something about\\nraising new questions when you settle old ones.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes,\\\" said Mr. Drury, \\\"I remember. Maybe saying it's the church's\\nown fault is not just the way to put it. Say instead that you can't\\neducate children, nor yet races that are developing, and expect them to\\nturn out exactly according to your notions of the future. Because, when\\ntheir minds are growing they are developing, not according to something\\nin you, but according to something in them. So every teacher, and I\\nsuppose every parent, has moments of wondering how it ever happens that\\nyoung people learn so much that is not taught them. And it's the same\\nway with races.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You mean,\\\" inquired J.W., \\\"that Hightower is like that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I mean,\\\" Pastor Drury replied, \\\"that everybody is like that. If we had\\ngiven the Negro no education at all, we could probably have kept him\\ncontented for a good many years with just being 'free.' If we had given\\nno Negro anything but a common-school chance, the race would have been\\npretty slow to develop discontent. But Hightower went to Yale, and Du\\nBois went to Harvard and Germany, and Pickens went to Yale, and so on.\\nThousands of colored men and women have been graduated from colleges of\\nliberal arts. And so they are not satisfied with conditions which would\\nhave been heavenly bliss to their grandfathers and grandmothers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know I'm stupid,\\\" said J.W., a trifle ruefully, \\\"but I've always\\nsupposed that education was good for everybody. Now you seem to say that\\neducation makes people discontented.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course it does,\\\" said Mr. Drury, \\\"that's the reason it is good for\\nthem. Would you be content to call a one-room shack home, and live as\\nthe plantation hand lives? If you would, the world's profit out of you,\\nand your own profit out of yourself, wouldn't be much. Real education\\ndoes exactly mean discontent. And the people who are discontented may be\\nuncomfortable to live with, if we think they ought to be docile, but\\nthey get us forward.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maybe you're right,\\\" J.W. conceded, \\\"and the church is not to be\\nblamed. Still, if our work for the black man has made him troublesome,\\nand given him ideas bigger than he can hope to realize, how does that\\nfit in with our Christianity? Shouldn't the church be a peacemaker,\\ninstead of a trouble-maker?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now, John Wesley, Jr.,\\\" the other said, in mock protest, \\\"that sermon\\nof mine on 'Not Peace, but a Sword' must have been wasted on you. Our\\nLord most certainly came to make peace, and he spoke a great blessing on\\npeacemakers. But he was himself the world's greatest disturber. Peace\\nwhile there is injustice, or ignorance, or any sort of wickedness, has\\nnothing to do with Christ's intentions. I know that the old-time\\nslave-traders of the North, and the more persistent slave-buyers of the\\nSouth, were always asking for that sort of peace. But they couldn't have\\nit. Nobody ever can have it, so long as Jesus has a single follower in\\nthe world.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, what has all this to do,\\\" asked J.W., \\\"with our church's special\\nwork for the colored people?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, yes,\\\" the pastor answered, \\\"that's the very thing you must find out\\nbefore you make that address of welcome.\\\"\\n\\nBy this time J.W. had gathered up a pile of books, pamphlets, reports,\\nand papers--enough, he thought, to serve as the raw material of a Ph.D.\\nthesis, and he said to Mr. Drury, \\\"Would you mind if I took this home?\\nI'll bring it all back, and it's not likely I'll damage it much.\\\".\\n\\nThe asking was no more than a form; for years the people of First Church\\nhad known themselves freely welcome to any book in the preacher's\\nshelves. An interest in his books was passport to his special favor. His\\nown evident love for books had been the best possible insurance that\\nthese particular borrowers would be more scrupulous than the general.\\nThis bit of pastoral work, it should be said, with the frequent\\nbook-talk that grew out of it, was not least among all the reasons why\\nFirst Church people thought their bachelor minister just the man for\\nthem.\\n\\nSo off went J.W. with his armful, and for a week thereafter you might\\nhave supposed he was cramming for a final exam of some sort. Early in\\nhis preparation he decided that his father's advice was wise, and he put\\nthe stress of his effort on the church's work and how Negro youth had\\nresponded to it. The other matter was too delicate, he felt, for his\\namateur handling, and, besides, he was not altogether sure even of his\\nown position.\\n\\nOn the convention night Saint Marks was crowded with young colored\\npeople, some of whom came from places a hundred miles away. They were\\nbadged and pennanted quite in the fashion to which J.W. was accustomed.\\nBut for their color, and, to be frank, for a little more restraint and\\nthoughtfulness in their really unusual singing, they were just young\\nMethodists at a convention, not different from Caucasian Methodists of\\nthe same age.\\n\\nWhen J.W.'s turn came to speak, the chairman introduced him in the\\nfewest possible words, but with the courtesy which belongs to\\nself-respect, saying, \\\"Mr. Farwell will make the delegates welcome in\\nthe name of the First Church Epworthians.\\\"\\n\\nAnd he did. He had his notes, pretty full ones, to which he made\\nfrequent references, but the quality in his speech which drew the\\nconvention's cheers was its frank and natural simplicity.\\n\\n\\\"I would have begged off from this duty, if I could,\\\" he began, \\\"but I\\nknew from the moment I was asked that I had no decent excuse. But I knew\\nso little of what I ought to say that it was necessary for me to dig,\\njust as I used to do at school.\\\"\\n\\nThe result of my digging is that I know now and I want you to know that\\nI know, why First Church young people should join in welcoming you to\\nDelafield. Some of them don't know yet, any more than I did ten days\\nago; but I intend to enlighten them the first chance I get.\\n\\nWe First Church Epworthians might welcome you for many reasons, but I\\nhave decided to stick to two, because, as I have said, I have just been\\nlearning something about them.\\n\\nWe welcome you, then, because you represent the most eager hunger for\\ncomplete education that exists in America to-day, unless our new Hebrew\\ncitizens can match it. No others can. The record of our church's schools\\nfor your race prove that it simply is not possible to keep the Negro\\nyouth out of school. They will walk further, eat less, work harder, and\\nstay longer to get an education than for anything else in the world.\\n\\nNot so many days ago I ignorantly thought that the 'three R's' was all\\nthat ought to be offered, partly because the need is so great. I hope\\nyou will forgive me that thought, when I tell you that now I know what\\nignorance it revealed in me. The great need is the strongest argument\\nfor the highest education. Because of your great numbers, and because\\nof your ever intenser racial self-respect, the Negro must educate the\\nNegro, be physician for the Negro, preach to the Negro, nurse the Negro,\\nlead the Negro in all his upward effort. Otherwise these things will be\\ndone badly, or patronizingly, or not at all.\\n\\nBut if you are to do your own educational work, your educators must be\\nfully equipped. It is not possible to send the whole race to college,\\nbut it is possible to send college-trained youth to the race. For this\\nreason our church has established normal schools, colleges of liberal\\narts, professional schools, homes for college girls, so that the coming\\nleaders of your people may have access to the best the world offers in\\nscience and literature, in medicine and law, in business and religion.\\n\\nYou will not mistake my purpose, I am sure, in saying that you know\\nbetter than we can guess how your people, through no fault of theirs,\\nhave been long in bondage to the unskilled hand, the unawakened mind,\\nand the uninspired heart. But it is more and more an unwilling bondage.\\n\\nAnd our church, your church, has set up these schools and these\\ntraining homes I have mentioned, as though she were saying, in the words\\nof one of your own wonderful songs, 'Let my people go!' And the results\\nare coming. Your two bishops, one in the South and one in Africa, your\\nleaders in the church's highest councils, your educators, your\\nfar-seeing business men, your great preachers, are part of the answer\\nto your church's passion to give full freedom to all her people.\\n\\nFor you are _her_ people, the people of the Christian Church; we are\\nall God's people. It seems to me that just now God is interested in\\nbringing to every race in the world the chance of liberty for hand and\\nhead and heart. God has greater things for us all to do than we can now\\nunderstand, but all his purposes must wait on our getting free from\\neverything that would defeat our work.\\n\\nOur First-Church young people welcome you because with all else you\\nrepresent a great purpose to make religion intelligent. You know, as we\\ndo, that piety to be vital must be mixed with sound learning. You have\\nthe missionary spirit, which never thrives in an atmosphere of\\nresistance to education. You are 'fellow Christians,' fellow workers. We\\nare sharers with you in personal devotion to our Lord, and in the common\\npurpose to make him Master of all life.\\n\\nAnd, finally, let me say it bluntly, we welcome you because we believe\\nin your pride of race, and honor it in you as we honor it in our fellow\\ncitizens of other races. They and you have some things in common, but\\nyou will not misunderstand me when I congratulate you on what is\\npeculiar to you. You have been fully Americanized for more generations\\nthan most other Americans. You have no need to strive after the American\\nspirit. I have a friend of Greek birth, who thinks pridefully back to\\nthe Golden Age of Greece, and I envy him his glorying. But your pride\\nof race, turning away from the unhappy past, sees your Golden Age in\\nthe days to come, not in the dim yesterdays. You are the makers, not the\\ninheritors, of a great destiny.\\n\\n\\\"For that noble future which is to be yours in our common America, you\\ndo well to hold as above price the purity and strength of your racial\\nlife. Better than we of Caucasian stock, you know that only so may all\\nthe values be fully realized which are to be Africa's contribution to\\nthe spiritual wealth of America and the world.\\\"\\n\\nThere was a moment of silence, for the implications of the last sentence\\nwere not as plain as they might have been. But when the audience caught\\nJ.W.'s somewhat daring appeal to its racial self-respect it broke into\\nsuch cheers as are not given to the polite phraser of conventional\\ncommonplaces.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\n\\nTHE FIRST AMERICAN CIVILIZATION\\n\\nThe full record of J.W.'s commercial career must he left to some other\\nchronicler, but an occasional reference to it cannot be omitted from\\nthese pages.\\n\\nPastor Drury's brother Albert, a Saint Louis business man who knew the\\nold city by the Mississippi from the levees to the University, was a\\ncitizen who loved his city so well that he did not need to join a\\nBoosters' Club to prove it. The two Drurys saw each other, as both\\naverred, all too seldom. On the infrequent occasions when they met, as,\\nfor instance, during a certain church federation gathering which had\\nbrought the minister down to Saint Louis from Delafield, their\\n\\\"visiting\\\" was a joyous thing to see.\\n\\nLounging in the City Club one day after lunch, with every other subject\\nof common interest at least touched on, Brother Albert turned to Brother\\nWalter: \\\"And how goes the church and parish of Delafield? You told me\\nlong ago that you wanted to stay there ten years; it's more than eight\\nnow. Does the ten-year mark yet stand?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Al., it still stands, if nothing should interfere,\\\" said Walter.\\nHe had never told his brother the reason back of that ten-year mark, and\\nhe was not ready, even yet, for that. Of late he had taken to wondering\\nwhen and how the Experiment would come to its crisis. He wanted some\\nhelp just now, and here might be an opening. So he went on, \\\"I've been\\nworking away at several special jobs, as you know I like to do, and one\\nof them has a good deal to do with a young fellow named Farwell, John\\nWesley Farwell, Jr., who'll be the mainstay of the best hardware store\\nin Delafield before long if he sticks to it. Everybody calls him 'J.W.,'\\nand he's the sort of boy that has always interested me, he's so\\n'average,'\\\" He paused; his thoughts busy with the Experiment.\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" his brother broke in, after a moment, \\\"what's this young John\\nWesley Methodist been doing?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It isn't altogether what he has been doing, but it's what I'd like to\\nsee him get a chance to do,\\\" explained the preacher. \\\"He's tied to the\\nstore and to Delafield, so far, and I've reasons for wanting him to see\\nsome parts of this country he'll never see from Main Street in our\\ntown.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, brother mine, maybe he could be induced to leave that particular\\nMain Street. There's where we get the best citizens of this village. Has\\nhe any objections to making a change--to travel, for instance?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know,\\\" said Walter; \\\"probably not. He's young, and has a pretty\\ngood education. I do know that he's ambitious to make himself the best\\nhardware man in our section, and I believe he'll do it, in time.\\nPersonally, I _want_ him to travel. But how would anybody go about\\ngetting him the chance?\\\"\\n\\nAlbert Drury laughed. \\\"That's easy, only a preacher couldn't be\\nexpected to see it. If any country boy really knows the stuff he\\nhandles, whether it is hardware or candy or hides, he can get the chance\\nall right. This town wants him. Don't you know that the big wholesale\\nhouses recruit their sales forces by spotting just such boys as your\\nJohn Wesley Farwell may be? But what do you mean by calling him average,\\nif he's such a keen judge of hardware?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, well, he _is_ more than average on hardware, but he's so\\nbeautifully average human; one of those chaps who do most of the real\\nwork of the world.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All right, old man; I'm not sure that I follow you; but, anyway, I may\\nbe of some use. I'll tell you what I'll do; I know the very man. Peter\\nMcDougall, who's a friend I can bank on, is sales manager of the\\nCummings Hardware Corporation. Nothing will come of it if Peter is not\\nimpressed, but all I need to do is to tell him there's a prospective\\nstar salesman up at Delafield, and his man who has that territory will\\nbe looking up your John Wesley before you have time to write another\\nsermon. By the way,\\\" he added, \\\"what part of the country did you say you\\nwanted young Farwell to see?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I didn't say,\\\" the preacher admitted, \\\"but I would like him to see\\nsomething of the Southwest. I want to see what will happen when he bumps\\nup against the sort of civilization that followed the Spanish to\\nAmerica.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, of course, you know that wholesale hardware houses don't run\\nsalesmen's excursions to help Methodist preachers try out the effect of\\nAmerican history on their young parishioners, no matter how lofty the\\nmotive,\\\" and Albert Drury poked his brother in the ribs. \\\"But supposing\\nthis boy is otherwise good stuff he'll be in the right place, if he goes\\nwith the Cummings people. A big share of their business is in that end\\nof the world.\\\"\\n\\nIf J.W. had been told of this conversation, which he wasn't, he might\\nnot have been quite so mystified over the letter from the great Peter\\nMcDougall, which came a few weeks after the preacher's return from Saint\\nLouis. McDougall he knew well by reputation, having heard about him from\\nevery Cummings man who unpacked samples in Delafield. And to be invited\\nto Saint Louis by the great man, with the possibility of \\\"an opening,\\nultimately, in our sales force,\\\" was a surprise as interesting as it was\\nunexpected. Naturally, J.W. could not know how much careful\\ninvestigation had preceded the writing of that letter. The Cummings\\nCorporation did not act on impulse. But he would have accepted the\\ninvitation in any case.\\n\\nAnd that is enough for the present purpose of the story of J.W.'s first\\nbusiness venture away from Delafield. Not without some hesitation did he\\nclose with the Cummings offer; but after he had talked it all over with\\nthe folks at home, and then all over again out at Deep Creek with\\nJeannette Shenk, who was both sorry and proud, it was settled. Reaching\\nSaint Louis, the canny McDougall looked him over and thought him worth\\ntrying out; so over he went to the stock department. Then followed busy\\nweeks in the buildings of the Cummings Hardware Corporation down by the\\nriver, learning the stock. He discovered before the end of the first day\\nthat he had never yet guessed what \\\"hardware\\\" meant; he wandered through\\nthe mazes of the vast warehouses until his legs ached much and his eyes\\nached more.\\n\\nAt last came the day when he found himself on the road, not alone, of\\ncourse, but in tow of Fred Finch, an old Cummings salesman who had\\noccasionally \\\"made\\\" Delafield. The Cummings people did not throw their\\nnew men overboard and let them swim if they could. They had a careful\\ntraining system, of which the stockroom days were one part, and this\\npersonally conducted introduction to the road was another.\\n\\nAlbert Drury had been sufficiently interested in his brother's wish to\\ndrop a hint to McDougall, to which that hard-headed executive would have\\npaid no attention if it had not fitted in just then with the\\nrequirements of his sales policy. But the hint sent J.W. out with Finch\\nover the longest route which the house worked for trade. On the map this\\nroute was a great kite-shaped thing, with its point at Saint Louis, and\\nthe whole Southwest this side of the Colorado River included in the\\nsweep of its sides and top.\\n\\nTo Fred Finch it was a weary journey, but J.W. gave no thought to its\\ndiscomforts. He was seeing the country, as well as learning to sell\\nhardware, and both occupations were highly absorbing. Before long he\\nfound too that he was seeing a new people. Storekeepers he knew, as\\nbeing of his own guild; the small towns were much like Delafield, when\\nyou had become used to their newer crudeness of architecture and their\\nsprawling planlessness; and the people who used hardware were very much\\nlike his customers at home.\\n\\nHe had no fear of failing to become a salesman, after the first few\\nexperiences under Finch's watchful eye; his father had taught him a sort\\nof salesmanship which experience could only make more effective. He knew\\nalready never to sell what he could see his customer ought not to buy,\\nand he knew always to contrive as much as possible that the customer\\nshould do the selling to himself. The elder Farwell used to say, \\\"Let\\nyour customer once see the advantage that buying is to him, and he won't\\ncare what advantage selling is to you.\\\"\\n\\nNow, as has been said before, this is not a salesman's story. Let it\\nsuffice to say that before the two got back to Saint Louis J.W. knew he\\nhad found his trade. He was a natural salesman, and so Fred Finch\\nreported to Peter McDougall. \\\"If it's hardware,\\\" he said, \\\"that boy can\\nsell it, and I don't care where you put him. He can sell to people who\\ncan't speak English, and I believe he could sell to deaf mutes or the\\nblind. He knows the line, and they know he knows it. Why, this very\\nfirst trip he's sold more goods on his own say-so than on the house\\nbrand. Said he knew what the stuff would do, and people took that who\\nusually want to know about the guarantee.\\\" All of which Peter McDougall\\nfiled where he would not forget it.\\n\\nBut to go back to the trip itself. Along the railway in Kansas J.W.\\nbegan to see box-cars without trucks, roughly fitted up for dwellings.\\nDark-skinned men and women and children were in occupation, and all the\\nhousehold functions and processes were going on, though somewhat\\nprimitively.\\n\\n\\\"Mexicans,\\\" said Finch, as J.W. pointed out the cars. \\\"Section hands;\\nwhen I first began to make this territory you never saw them except\\nright down on the border, but they have moved a long way east and north.\\nI saw lots of them in the yards at Kansas City last time I was there.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. watched the box-car life with a good deal of curiosity. Here and\\nthere were poor little attempts at color and adornment; flowers in\\nwindow boxes and bits of lace at the windows. Delafield had plenty of\\nforeigners, but these were foreigners of another sort. They seemed to be\\nentirely at home.\\n\\n\\\"I suppose,\\\" he said to Finch, \\\"these Mexicans have come to the States\\nto get away from the robbery and ruin that Mexico has had instead of\\ngovernment these last ten years and more.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" Finch answered, \\\"thousands of 'em. But not all. Some of these\\nMexicans are older Americans than we are. We took 'em over when we got\\nTexas and New Mexico and California from Old Mexico. They were here\\nthen, speaking the Spanish their ancestors had learned three hundred\\nyears ago and more. But they're all the same Mexicans, no matter on\\nwhich side of the Rio Grande they were born. Of course those born on\\nthis side have had some advantages that the peons never knew.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But do you mean,\\\" J.W. wanted to know, \\\"that they are not really\\nAmerican citizens?\\\"\\n\\nFred Finch said no, he didn't mean exactly that. Certainly, those born\\non this side were American citizens in the eyes of the law, and those\\nwho came across the Rio Grande could get naturalized. But that made\\nlittle real difference. A Mexican was a Mexican, and you had to deal\\nwith him as one.\\n\\nJ.W. was not quite satisfied with that explanation, but he preferred to\\nwait until he had seen enough so that he could ask his questions more\\nintelligently. So he kept relatively still, but his eyes did not cease\\nfrom observing.\\n\\nAs the trip progressed, and the jumps between towns became longer, the\\nyoung salesman had time to see a good deal. In the far Southwest he\\nbecame aware that the increasingly numerous Mexican population was no\\nlonger a matter of box-car dwellers, more or less migratory. It was a\\nsettled people. Its little adobe villages, queer and quaint as they\\nseemed to Middle-Western eyes, were centers of established life. And he\\ndiscovered that in these villages always one building overshadowed all\\nthe rest.\\n\\nOne day as they were headed towards El Paso he ventured to mention this\\nto his traveling companion. \\\"Seems to me,\\\" he said, \\\"that none of these\\nlittle mud villages is too poor to have a church, and mostly a pretty\\ngood church too. How do they manage it?\\\"\\n\\nNow Finch was no student of church life, but he did know a little about\\nthe country. \\\"That's the way it is all over this Southwest, my boy, and\\nacross the line in Old Mexico it's a good deal more so. My guess is that\\nthe churches and the priests began by teaching the people that whatever\\nelse happened they had to put up for the church, and from what I've\\nnoticed I reckon that now nothing else matters much to the church. It\\nhas become a kind of poor relation that's got to be fed and helped,\\nwhether it amounts to anything or not. But it's a long way from being as\\nhumble and thankful as you would naturally expect a poor relation to\\nbe.\\\"\\n\\nDuring the El Paso layover the two of them took a day across the\\nInternational Bridge. J.W. had watched the Mexicans coming over, and he\\nwanted to see the country they came from.\\n\\n\\\"You'll not see much over there,\\\" a friendly spoken customs official\\ntold him. \\\"It's a pretty poor section of desert 'round about these\\nparts. You ought to get away down into the heart of the country.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I suppose so,\\\" J.W. responded, \\\"but there isn't time on this trip.\\nAre such people as these coming over to the United States right along?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should say they are,\\\" said the man of authority with emphasis. \\\"In\\nthe last four or five years the Mexican population of the United States\\nhas about doubled; three quarters of a million have crossed the Rio\\nGrande somewhere, or the border further west. You people from the East\\nmake a big fuss over immigration from Europe, but you hardly seem to\\nknow that a regular flood has been pouring in through these southwestern\\ngateways. You will some day.\\\"\\n\\nWhat they saw on the Mexican side of the bridge was, as the customs man\\nhad said, nothing much. But J.W. came away with a strange sense of\\ndepression. He had never before seen so much of the raw material of\\nmisery and squalor; what he had observed with wondering pity in the\\nvillages on the American side was as nothing to the unrelieved\\nhopelessness of the south bank of the river.\\n\\nThat night in the hotel lobby J.W. noticed a fresh-faced but rather\\nelderly man whom he recognized as one whom he had seen over in Mexico\\nearlier in the day. With the memory of what he had seen yet fresh upon\\nhim, J.W. ventured a commonplace or two with the stranger, and found him\\nso genial and interesting that they were still talking long after Fred\\nFinch had yawned himself off to bed.\\n\\n\\\"I thought I remembered seeing you over there,\\\" said the unknown, \\\"and\\nyou didn't look like a seasoned traveler; more like the amateur I am\\nmyself, though I do get about a little.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm no seasoned sightseer,\\\" said J.W.; \\\"this is my first time out. And\\nthat's maybe the reason I've developed so much curiosity about the\\npeople we saw to-day. Do you know much about them?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who? the Mexicans?\\\" The other man smiled, and then was suddenly\\nserious. \\\"My friend, I begin to think I'm making the Mexicans my hobby.\\nI don't know who you are, but if you are really interested in the\\nMexicans as human beings I'd rather tell you what I know than do\\nanything else I can think of to-night. It isn't often I find a traveling\\nman who cares.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I do care,\\\" J.W. asserted, stoutly. \\\"They're people, folks,\\naren't they? And it looks as though they could stand having somebody get\\ninterested in them a little.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, I see now what you are; you are that remarkable combination, a\\ntraveling man and a Christian. Am I right?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, I suppose so,\\\" said J.W., with a smile and a touch of the old\\nboyish pride in his name. \\\"My initials, as you might say, are 'John\\nWesley,' and I'm not ashamed of them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And that means you are not only a Christian, but a Methodist? My dear\\nman, we must shake on that. I'm a Methodist myself, as the stage robber\\nsaid to Brother Van, with the romantic name of Tanner. Got my first\\ninterest in Mexico and the Mexicans when my daughter married a young\\nMethodist preacher and they went down there as missionaries. I make a\\ntrip to see them and the babies about once a year. But now I am getting\\ninterested in these people as an American and, I hope, a Christian who\\ntries to work at the business. What did you say your other name was?\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. hadn't said, but now he did, and the two settled to their talk.\\nThis William Tanner, some sort of retired business man, certainly seemed\\nto know his Mexico. And he had that most subtle of all stimulants\\nto-night, a curious and sympathetic hearer. By consequence he was eager\\nto give all that J.W. would take.\\n\\nBefore long J.W. had edged in a question about the church. He said, \\\"You\\nknow, Mr. Tanner, we have a pretty good Roman Catholic church in my home\\ntown, though Father O'Neill doesn't tie up much to what the other\\nchurches are trying to do, and some of his flock seem to me pretty wild,\\nfor sheep. Now, these churches down here are all Roman Catholic too, yet\\nthey certainly don't look any kin to Saint Ursula's at Delafield. Are\\nthey?\\\"\\n\\nIt was the sort of question which William Tanner had asked himself many\\na time when he first came to Mexico. \\\"This is the way of it, Mr.\\nFarwell,\\\" he said. \\\"The church came to Mexico, and to all Latin America,\\nfrom Spain and Portugal. It had a few great names, we must acknowledge,\\nin those early times. But in a little while it settled down to two\\nactivities--to make itself the sole religious authority and to get rich.\\nIt was a church of God and gold, and as a matter of course it preached\\nthat it was the supreme arbiter of life and death in matters of faith,\\nand extended its authority into every relation of life. It brought from\\nthe lands of the Inquisition the idea of priestly power, and there was\\nnone to dispute it in Latin America, as there was in the colonies of our\\nown country. It gave the people little instruction, and no\\nresponsibility or freedom. It made outward submission the test of piety\\nand faith. And so when Spain lost its grip on the western hemisphere the\\nchurch found itself with nothing but its claim of power to fall back on.\\nWell, you know that would work only with the ignorant and the\\nsuperstitious.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mexico, and all Latin America for that matter, clear to the Straits of\\nMagellan, is a land of innumerable crosses, but no Christ. The church\\nhas had left to it what it wanted; that is, the priestly prerogatives;\\nit marries, baptizes, absolves, buries, where the people can pay the\\nfees, and the people for various reasons have not cared that this is\\nall. If they are afraid, or want to make a show, they call in the\\nchurch; if they don't care, or if they are poor, they go unbaptized,\\nunmarried, unshriven, and do not see that it makes any difference. They\\nhave no understanding of the church as a Christian institution; in fact,\\nI think it would puzzle most of them to tell what a true church ought to\\nbe. Now, all this is the church's reward for its ancient choice, which,\\nso far as I can see, is still its choice. To the average Latin American\\nthe church is, and in the nature of things must be, a demander of pay\\nfor ceremonial, and a bitterly jealous defender of all its old\\nautocratic claims. That is of the nature of the church.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I don't understand,\\\" interposed J.W. \\\"If the people have no real\\nuse for the church, why do they support it? It certainly is supported.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That, Mr. Farwell, is the tragedy of the church in all these lands,\\\"\\nsaid Mr. Tanner, soberly. \\\"The church began by looking to its own\\ninterests first. It wanted great establishments and a docile people. It\\nfound the gospel hard to preach to the natives--the real gospel, I mean.\\nThe cruelties and greed of the conquest had made impossible any\\npreaching of a ministering, merciful, and unselfish Christ. In fact, the\\nvast majority of the priests who came over from Europe brought with them\\nno such ideas. The church was ruler, not missionary. And so far as it\\ndares it sticks stubbornly to that notion even to this day. So it has\\nhad to make practical compromise with the paganism and superstition it\\nfound here. Many of its religious observances are the aboriginal pagan\\npractices disguised in Christian dress and given Christian names. The\\nchurch has sold its birthright for the privilege of exploiting the\\ncredulity and the fears of the people. It has made merchandise of all\\nits functions. Now, after the centuries have come and gone, both church\\nand people through long custom are willing to have it so. The people\\nhave their great churches, with incense and lights and all the pomp of\\nmedaeival days. But they have no living Christ and no thought of him. The\\npriests have their trade in ceremonial and their perquisites, but they\\nhave no power over the hearts of men.\\\"\\n\\nAs his new acquaintance paused for breath after this long answer to a\\nshort question, J.W., remembering something Fred Finch had said, brought\\nthe remark in: \\\"The man who is showing me the ropes as a hardware man\\ntells me that all over Latin America the church is likely to be the one\\nreal building in every town and village. Is that also something that\\nthe people are so used to that they don't notice it any more?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes,\\\" Mr. Tanner assented. \\\"I suppose the contrast between the\\nchurch and the miserable little hovels around it never occurs to any of\\nthem. It has always been so. The church has built itself up out of the\\ncommunity, and for the most part it puts very little back. It conducts\\nschools, to be sure; and yet eighty per cent of the Mexican people are\\nilliterate, it has some few institutions of help and mercy; but the\\nwhole land cries out for doctors and teachers and friendly human\\nconcern.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is that really so?\\\" J.W. asked. \\\"Do the people really want our\\nmissionaries, or are we Protestants just shoving ourselves in? I can see\\nthat something is desperately wrong, but we are mostly Saxon, and they\\nare Latins. Do these people want what to them must seem a queer religion\\nand a lot of strange ideas?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So long as they do not understand what we come for, naturally they are\\nsuspicious. When they find out, they take to mission work and\\nmissionaries with very little urging. I wish you would meet my\\nson-in-law,\\\" Mr. Tanner said with positiveness. \\\"Why, the one tormenting\\ndesire of that man's life is to see more missionaries sent down into\\nMexico; more doctors, more teachers, more workers of every sort. He\\nwrites letters to the Board of Foreign Missions that would make your\\nheart ache. The church at home couldn't oversupply Mexico with the sort\\nof help it desperately needs if it should turn every recruit that way,\\nand disregard all the rest of the world's mission fields.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you mean,\\\" asked J.W., who was seeing new questions bob up every\\ntime an earlier one was answered, \\\"do you mean that so many missionaries\\ncould be used on productive Christian work right away? Or is it that we\\nought to have a big force to prepare for the long future of our work in\\nMexico?\\\" Now, J.W. was not so sure that this was an intelligent\\nquestion, but he had heard that in some mission fields it was necessary\\nto wait years for real and permanent results.\\n\\nHis companion saw nothing out of the way in the question. It was part of\\nthe whole problem. \\\"I mean it both ways,\\\" he said. \\\"What I've seen of\\nour Methodist work down in these parts, particularly its schools and one\\nwonderful hospital, makes me sure we could get big harvests of interest\\nand success right off. We're doing it already, considering our\\nrelatively small force and our limited equipment.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But all Latin American work takes patience. I've made one trip down as\\nfar as Santiago de Chile, and what is true in Mexico is, I guess, about\\nas true in other parts. The Roman Catholic Church has been here four\\nhundred years, and its biggest result is that the people who don't fear\\nit despise it. Latin America is called Christian, but it is a world in\\nwhich what you and I call religion simply does not count. Well, then,\\nthat's what makes me talk about the need of persistence and patience.\\nThe bad effects of three or four hundred years of such religion as has\\nbeen taught and practiced between the Rio Grande and Cape Horn can't be\\ngot rid of in a hurry. Wait till Mexico has had a real chance at the\\nChrist of the New Testament for three hundred years, and then see!\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. had yet another question to ask before he was ready to call it a\\nday. \\\"If all that you say is so--and I believe it is, Mr. Tanner--why\\nshould so many of the Mexicans hate the United States? They do, for I've\\nheard it spoken of a good deal lately, and I remember what was always\\nsaid when some one proposed that we should intervene to make peace and\\nrestore order in Mexico. It would take ten years and a million men, and\\nall Mexico would unite to oppose us. You talk about how much the\\nMexicans need us and want us. But a great many of them surely don't want\\nus at all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know what that means,\\\" Mr. Tanner admitted. And it is true. We are\\nall influenced by the past. Look at the history of our dealings with\\nMexico. The very ideas we fought to establish as the charter of our own\\nfreedom we repudiated when we dealt with Mexico three quarters of a\\ncentury ago. We had every advantage, and what we wanted we took.\\nCertainly, we have done better by it than Mexico might have done, but I\\nnever heard that reason given in a court of law to excuse the same sort\\nof transaction if it touched only private individuals. Then, in late\\nyears big business has gone into Mexico. It has had to take big chances.\\nIt has paid better wages than the peon could earn any other way. It has\\na lot to its credit; but it has been much like big business in other\\nplaces, and, anyway, the admitted great profits have enriched the\\nforeigner, not the Mexican.\\n\\n\\\"Besides, Mexico is not the States. As you say, it is Latin in its\\ncivilization, not Saxon. It does not want our sort of culture. And some\\nof our missionaries, both of the church and of industry, have thought\\nthat the Mexican ought to be 'Americanized.' That's a fatal mistake in\\nany mission field outside the States. All in all, you can see that it\\nisn't entirely inevitable that the Mexican should understand our\\nmotives, or appreciate them when he does understand. But that's all the\\nmore reason for bearing down hard on every form of genuine missionary\\nwork. It's the only thing that we Americans can do in Mexico with any\\nhope of avoiding suspicion or of our presence being acceptable to the\\nMexicans in the long run. We've got to fight the backfire of our\\nAmerican commercialism, and the prejudice which is as real on the Texas\\nside of the river as it is on the other; for if the Mexican thinks in\\nterms of 'gringo,' the American of the Southwest is just as likely to\\nthink in terms of 'greaser.'\\\"\\n\\nWhen J.W. and Mr. Tanner parted for the night it was with the mutual\\npromise that they would have another talk some time the next day, but\\nthe promise could not be kept. The retired business man heard from some\\nof his business in the early morning, and had just time to say a hurried\\nfarewell. As he put it, \\\"I thought I had retired, but unless I get back\\nto look after this particular affair I may have to get into the harness\\nagain, and that is not a cheerful prospect at my age. So I go to\\nbusiness to avert the danger of going back to business.\\\"\\n\\nA little later the two hardware salesmen were in El Paso again, after a\\ncouple of side trips. J.W. took advantage of a long train wait to hunt\\nup the city library. He wanted to know whether Mr. Tanner was right in\\nsaying that the Latin-American question was much the same everywhere.\\n\\nHe wrote a letter to Mr. Drury that night, having thus far used picture\\npostcards until he was ashamed. In the letter he took occasion to\\nmention his talk with the \\\"missionary father-in-law,\\\" and his own bit of\\nreading up on the subject.\\n\\nSaid he: \\\"I guess that man Tanner was right. He did not speak much of\\nthe difference between the people of one country and those of another,\\nwhich rather surprised me. He said nothing of the two great classes, the\\nrulers with much European blood, and the peons, largely or altogether\\nIndian. There must be all sorts of Latin Americans, rich and poor, mixed\\nblood of many strains, Castilian and Aztec and Inca, and whatever other\\npeople were here when Columbus set the fashion for American voyages. But\\nthis is where this 'missionary father-in-law' hit the heart of the\\ntrouble: Latin America has all sorts and conditions of men, but\\neverywhere it has the same church. And it is a church that can't ever\\nmake good any more. It might, at the beginning, but it can't now. It has\\na reputation as fixed as Julius Caesar's. I'm hardly ready to set up as\\nan expert observer, being only a cub salesman on his first trip, but,\\nMr. Drury, I believe I can see already that the only chance for these\\npeople to get religion and everything else which religion ought to\\nproduce, is for us to send it to them. Maybe that would stir up the\\nchurch down here, and help to give it another chance at the people's\\nconfidence, though I'm not sure.\\\"\\n\\nOur church ought to send doctors; the amount of fearful disease that\\nflourishes among the poorer people is just frightful. If Joe Carbrook\\nwere not so set on going to the Orient, he could do a big work here, and\\nso could a thousand other doctors. It would be so much more than mere\\ndoctoring; it would be the biggest kind of preaching.\\n\\nAnd the church should send teachers. You know I believe in conversion;\\nbut if the Mexicans I have seen are samples of Latin America's common\\npeople, they need teachers who have the patience of Christ a good deal\\nmore than they need flaming evangelists who make a big stir and soon\\npass on. Because these folks have just _got_ to be made over, in their\\nvery minds. They are not ready for the preaching of the gospel until\\nthey have seen it lived. Long experience has made them doubtful of\\nliving saints, though plenty of them pray to dead ones.\\n\\nThis is the whole trouble, Mr. Drury, it seems to me. They've known\\nonly a church that had got off the track. Any religious work that\\nreaches them now has almost to begin all over again. It has to undo\\ntheir thinking about prayer and faith and God's love and human conduct\\nand nearly every other Christian idea. They have a Christian vocabulary,\\nbut it means very little. They think they can buy religion, if they want\\nit--any kind they want. And if they can't afford it, or don't want it,\\nthey don't quite think they'll be sent to hell for that, in spite of\\nwhat the priest says. They think enough to be afraid, but not enough to\\nbe sure of anything. The missionaries have to teach them a new set of\\nreligious numerals, if you get what I mean, before it is any use to\\nteach them the arithmetic of the gospel.\\n\\n\\\"I'm beginning to see that everything among the Latin Americans runs\\nback to the need of Christian living. The wrong notion of religion has\\ngot them all twisted. I know Delafield is a long way from being\\nChristian, but the difference between Delafield and such a pitiful mud\\nvillage as I've seen lately has more to do with the sort of Christianity\\neach place has been taught than with anything else whatever. But I never\\nthought of that before.\\\"\\n\\nAs Pastor Drury read that letter his heart warmed within him. He said to\\nhimself, \\\"John Wesley, Jr., is 'beginning to see,' he says. Please God\\nhe musn't stop now until he gets his eyes wide open. The thing is\\nworking out. He's groping around for something, and some day he'll find\\nit.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\nCHRIST AND THE EAST\\n\\nFor a first trip the Southwestern expedition under Fred Finch's tutelage\\nhad been something of an exploit. Finch's report to Peter McDougall was\\nmore than verified by the order sheets, and the observant Peter, keeping\\ntrack of things during the succeeding weeks, noticed with quiet\\nsatisfaction that not a single order Was canceled.\\n\\nTo himself he said, \\\"The lad's a find, I'm thinking. From Finch's talk I\\nshould say he has not only a natural knack of selling, but he sells for\\nkeeps. And that's the idea, Peter. Anybody can sell if the buyer means\\nto call off the order by the next mail. This John Wesley boy may go far,\\nand I'll have to tell Albert Drury the next time I see him that he's\\ndone the house of Cummings a real favor.\\\"\\n\\nThe months went by. J.W. kept his wits about him, and on the road he\\nstuck to his salesman's faith that goods are better sold by those who\\nknow exactly how they may be used and that they are never sold until\\nthey are bought. So he found favor in the sight of Peter McDougall. The\\nproof of that is easy. Peter gave him a week off before the end of his\\nfirst year.\\n\\nDelafield looked better to the homecoming salesman than it had to the\\nboy coming back from college. And the town was glad to see him. He\\nmeant something to not a few of its people, altogether outside the\\ninterest of the Farwells--and Pastor Drury--and Jeannette!\\n\\nDeep Creek was his first port of call, after his first half-day at home.\\nHe had been welcomed with deep, quiet gladness by the home folks, and he\\nhad talked a little over the telephone with the preacher. Then time was\\na laggard until he could head the Farwell car toward Deep Creek and the\\nold farm.\\n\\nJeannette's welcome was all that even he could ask, though, of course,\\njust precisely what it was is none of our business. In the car, and by\\nthe fireplace in the Shenk living room, and around the farm, they\\nconsidered many things, some of them not so personal as others. J.W.\\ntold the story of his life in Saint Louis and on the road; Jeannette\\nlistening like another Desdemona to the recital. And once again it was\\nnot the adventure which supplied the thrill, but the adventurer.\\n\\nAnd Jeannette told him the news of Delafield. How Joe Carbrook and\\nMarcia Dayne's wedding had been the most wonderful wedding ever seen in\\nDelafield, with the town as proud of its one-time scapegrace as it was\\nof the beautiful bride. How brother Marty had been finding many excuses\\nof late for driving up from his circuit, and how he managed to see Alma\\nWetherell a good deal. How Alma was now head bookkeeper and cashier of\\nthe Emporium, the town's biggest store, and how she was such a dear\\ngirl. How Pastor Drury and Marty had become great friends. How the\\nminister was not so well as usual, and people were getting to be a\\nlittle worried about him. How the Delafield church had taken up tithing,\\nand was not only doing a lot better financially, but in every other way.\\nHow Deep Creek was going to have a new minister, a friend whom Marty had\\nmet at the summer school for rural ministers, who would try to help the\\nDeep Creek people get an up-to-date church building and learn to use it.\\nHow the Everyday Doctrines of Delafield had been first boosted and then\\nforgotten, and now again several of them were being practiced in some\\nquarters. And much more, though never to the wearing out of J.W.'s\\ninterest. Certainly not, the news being just what he wanted to know, and\\nthe reporter thereof being just the person he wanted to tell it to him.\\n\\nOne bit of news Jeannette did not tell, for the sufficient reason that\\nshe did not know it. Pastor Drury and Brother Marty _had_ become great\\nfriends, but what Jeannette could not tell was the special bond of\\ninterest which was back of the fact. Marty had long been aware that for\\nsome reason the Delafield pastor was peculiarly concerned about J.W.\\nNever did he guess Walter Drury's secret, but he knew well enough there\\nwas one.\\n\\nThese two, the town preacher and the young circuit rider, read to each\\nother J.W.'s letters, and talked much about him and his experiences, and\\nmade J.W. in general the theme of many discussions.\\n\\n\\\"It has been good for the boy that he has had that border trip,\\\" said\\nthe pastor to Marty a few days before J.W. got back. \\\"Don't you think\\nso?\\\"\\n\\nMarty was, as ever, J.W.'s ardent and self-effacing chum. \\\"I certainly\\ndo,\\\" he said. \\\"He's growing, is J.W., and growing the right way. We need\\nbusiness men of just the quality that's showing in him.\\\"\\n\\nThe pastor hesitated a moment. Then he spoke: \\\"Marty, when J.W. comes\\nhome I hope something will set him thinking about the outer world that\\nhas no word of our Christ. He hasn't seen it yet, not clearly; and you\\nknow that there isn't any hope for that world to get out of the depths\\nuntil it gets the news of a Helper. I'm counting on you to help me with\\nJ.W. if the chance comes. Just between ourselves, you know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll do all I can, Mr. Drury; you may be sure of that,\\\" said Marty. And\\nhe did.\\n\\nJ.W.'s holiday brought several young people together who had not met for\\na long time. Marty came up again, and spent the day with J.W., all over\\ntown, from the store to the house and back again. In the evening Mrs.\\nFarwell made a feast, to which, besides Marty, Jeannette and Alma and\\nPastor Drury were bidden. Mrs. Farwell was much more to Delafield than\\nthe best cook and the most remarkable housekeeper in the place, but her\\nson insisted that she was these to begin with. Certainly, she had not\\nbeen experimenting on the two J.W.'s all these years for nothing.\\n\\nAfter dinner--talk. No need of any other game in that company at such a\\ntime. There was plenty to talk about, and all had their reasons for\\nenjoying it. Naturally, J.W. must tell about himself. Letters are all\\nvery well, but they are no more than makeshifts, after all. He was\\nmodest enough about it, not having any special exploits to parade before\\ntheir wondering eyes, but quite willing. His Western experiences being\\ncalled for, he was soon telling, not of desert and cactus and\\nirrigation, but of the people who had so taken his attention, the\\nMexicans.\\n\\n\\\"I believe,\\\" said he, \\\"that we can do something really big down there.\\nAnd it's our business. Nobody except American Christians will do it;\\nnobody else can. Besides, the Mexicans are Christians in name, now. What\\nthey need is the reality. They are not impossible--just uncertain. All I\\nheard and what little I saw made me believe they are suffering from bad\\nleadership and ignorance more than from anything hopelessly wrong. They\\nseem easy to get along with. The women are the most patient workers I\\never heard of. And the poor Mexicans, the 'peons,' do want an end to\\nfighting and banditry.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, J.W.,\\\" Marty asked, \\\"what's the first thing we ought to think\\nabout for Mexico?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I told you I don't know anything about Mexico, except at second-hand.\\nBut, I should say, schools. Schools are good for any land, don't you\\nthink, Mr. Drury? And in Mexico they are such great disturbers of the\\nold slouching indifference. They will make the right kind of\\ndiscontent. Schools bring other things; new ideas of health and\\nsanitation, home improvement, social outlook, and all that. Then, with\\nthe schools, I guess, the straight gospel. The Mexicans won't get\\nconverted all at once, and they won't become like us, ever. But I'm\\nabout ready to say that whether missions are needed anywhere else or\\nnot, they surely are needed in Mexico. And Mexico is the first\\nstepping-stone to South America; which is next on my list of the places\\nthat ought to have the whole scheme of Christian teaching and life.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Alma, \\\"and you know, I suppose, that the beginning of our\\nPanama Mission was an Epworth League Institute enterprise? Well, it was.\\nCalifornia young people assumed the support of the first missionary sent\\nthere, and later he went on down to South America, with the same young\\npeople determined to take him on as their representative, just as they\\ndid in Panama.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where did you get that story?\\\" J.W. wanted to know.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I forgot,\\\" Alma answered him, laughing. \\\"You haven't had time to\\nread The Epworth Herald in Saint Louis.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I have, young lady,\\\" J.W. retorted, \\\"but I missed that. Anyway,\\nit's on the right track. I think we've got to change the thinking of all\\nLatin America about Christianity, if we can. Most of the men, they say,\\nare atheists, made so very largely by their loss of faith in the church;\\nand many of the women substitute an almost fierce devotion to the same\\nchurch for what we think of as being genuine religion.\\\"\\n\\nThe minister spoke up just here. \\\"I should think it would be pretty\\ndifficult to treat our United States Mexicans in one way, and those\\nacross the Rio Grande in another. We must evangelize on both sides of\\nthe river, but only on this side can we even attempt to Americanize.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's right,\\\" J.W. affirmed. \\\"And even on this side we can't do what\\nwe may do in Delafield. The language is a big question, and it has two\\nsides. But no matter what the difficulties, I'm for a great advance of\\nmissions and education, starting with Mexico and going all the way to\\nCape Horn.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's all very fine,\\\" interposed Marty, \\\"but what about the rest of\\nthe world, J.W.? What about the world that has not even the beginning of\\nChristian knowledge?\\\" Marty had put the question on the urge of the\\nmoment, and not until it was out did he remember that Mr. Drury had\\nasked him to help raise this very issue.\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" J.W. answered, slowly, \\\"maybe that part of the world is worse,\\nthough I don't know. But we can't tackle everything. Latin America is an\\nimmense job by itself, and we have some real responsibility there; a\\nsort of Christian Monroe Doctrine. Ought we to scatter our forces? The\\nnon-Christian world has its own religions, and has had them for\\nhundreds, maybe thousands of years. What's the hurry just now? If we\\ncould do everything, we Protestant Christians, I mean, in this country\\nand Britain, it might be different, but we can't. Why not concentrate?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" Marty came back, \\\"but not because Latin America is so nearly\\nChristian. What about this atheism and superstition and ignorance; isn't\\nit just a non-Christian civilization with Christian labels on some parts\\nof it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"One thing I've heard,\\\" put in Jeannette, not that she wanted to argue,\\nbut she felt she ought to say something on J.W.'s side if she could,\\n\\\"that the religions of the Orient, at least, are really great religions,\\nmore suited to the minds of the people than any other. 'East is East,\\nand West is West,' you know. But, of course, the people don't live up to\\nthe high levels of their beliefs. Americans don't, either.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Drury shot an amused yet admiring glance at Jeannette. What a loyal\\nsoul she was! Then said he: \\\"The religions of the East _are_ great\\nreligions, Jeannette. They represent the best that men can do. The\\nOrient has a genius for religion, and it has produced far better systems\\nthan the West could have done. Some of the truth that we Western people\\nget only in Christianity the thinkers of Asia worked out for themselves.\\nBut God was back of it all.\\\"\\n\\nThat suited J.W.'s present mood. \\\"All right, then; let's clean up as we\\ngo--Delafield, Saint Louis, the Southwest, Mexico, Latin America; that's\\nthe logical order. Then the rest of the world.\\\"\\n\\nMarty put in a protest here: \\\"That won't do, old man. Your logic's lame.\\nYou want us to go into Mexico now, with all we've got. Your letters\\nhave said so, and you've said it again to-night. But we're not 'cleaning\\nup as we go.' Look at Delafield; the town you've moved away from. Look\\nat Saint Louis; the town where you make your living. Are they\\nChristianized? Cleaned up? Yet you are ready for Mexico. No; you're all\\nwrong, J.W. I don't believe the world's going to be saved the way you\\nbreak up prairie sod, a field at a time, and let the rest alone. We've\\ngot to do our missionary work the way they feed famine sufferers. They\\ndon't give any applicant all he can eat, but they try to make the supply\\ngo 'round, giving each one a little. Remember, J.W., the rest of the\\nworld is as human as our western hemisphere.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know,\\\" admitted J.W. \\\"And I don't say I've got the right of it. I'd\\nhave to see the Orient before I made up my mind. But those countries\\nhave waited a long while. A few more years wouldn't be any great\\nmatter.\\\"\\n\\nAlma Wetherell now joined the opposition. It looked as though J.W. and\\nJeannette must stand alone, for the old people said nothing, though they\\nlistened with eager ears. Said Alma, \\\"I think it would matter a lot. The\\nmore we do for one people, while ignoring all the others, the less we\\nshould care to drop a developing work to begin at the bottom somewhere\\nelse.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There's something in that,\\\" J.W. conceded. \\\"I'm not meaning to be\\nstubborn. But I've had just a glimpse of the size of the missionary job\\nin one little corner of the world. Even that is too big for us. We could\\nput our whole missionary investment into Mexico without being able to do\\nwhat is needed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The missionary job, as you call it, is too big, certainly, for our\\npresent resources,\\\" said the pastor. \\\"Everybody knows that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Marty, who wondered if Mr. Drury had forgotten their compact\\nabout J.W., \\\"but why limit ourselves to our present resources? They are\\nnot all we could get, if the church came to believe in the bigness of\\nher privilege. I'd like to see for myself, as J.W. says, but I can't.\\nWhy don't you get a real traveling job, and go about the world looking\\nthings over for us, old man?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Me?\\\" J.W. said, sarcastically; \\\"yes, that's a likely prospect. Just as\\nI'm getting over being scared by a sample case. I'll do well to hold the\\njob I've got.\\\"\\n\\nAlma didn't know what Marty's game was, but she played up to his\\nsuggestion. \\\"Why shouldn't you go?\\\" she asked. \\\"You've told us that\\nCummings hardware and tools are sold all over the world. Doesn't that\\nmean salesmen? And aren't you a salesman? They have to send somebody;\\nwhy shouldn't they pick on you some time?\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. rose to the lure, for the moment all salesman. \\\"Nothing in it,\\nAlma; no chance at all. But I would like to show the world the\\ncivilizing values of good tools, and I'd go if I got the chance.\\\"\\n\\nJeannette's reaction was quicker than thinking; \\\"Would you go half way\\naround the world just for that?\\\" she asked, with a hint of alarm.\\n\\n\\\"Why, yes, I would,\\\" said J.W., \\\"that is, if you were willing.\\\"\\n\\nWhereupon everybody laughed but Jeannette, whose pale cheeks flamed into\\nsudden rosiness.\\n\\nThe minister came to her rescue. \\\"It would be a good thing every way, if\\nmore laymen would see the realities of Oriental life and bring back an\\nimpartial report. Suppose you should be right, J.W., and we found that\\nthe Orient could wait until the western hemisphere had been thoroughly\\nChristianized. Think how many thousands--perhaps millions--of dollars\\ncould be directed into more productive channels. I can see what a great\\ninfluence such reports would have if they came from Christian laymen. We\\nhave learned to expect stories of complete failure when the ordinary\\ntraveler comes back; and maybe the missionaries have their bias too. But\\nbusiness men with Christian ideals--that would be different.\\\"\\n\\nNow, all this was far from unpleasant to J.W. He detested posing, but\\nwhy wouldn't it be worth something to have laymen report on missionary\\nwork? Of course, though, if the time ever came when the firm was willing\\nto trust him abroad, he wouldn't have much chance to study missions.\\nBusiness would have to come first. It was no less a dream for being an\\nagreeable one.\\n\\n\\\"There's no danger of my going,\\\" he told them. \\\"The Cummings people are\\nnot sending cub salesmen to promote their big Asiatic trade. What could\\nthey make by it?\\\"\\n\\nThen the talk drifted to the Carbrooks. Marty said, \\\"Well, we've spoiled\\nyour scheme a little, J.W., right here in Delafield. Joe Carbrook and\\nMarcia are in China by now, and I'd like to see both of 'em as they get\\ndown to work. You can't keep all our interest on this side of the\\nPacific so long as those two are on the other.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said J.W., warmly, \\\"and I don't want to. I'll help to back up\\nthose two missionaries wherever they go.\\\" And his thoughts went back to\\ncamp fire night at Cartwright Institute, when he had said to Joe\\nCarbrook without suspecting the consequences, \\\"Say, Joe; if you think\\nyou could be a doctor, why not a missionary doctor?\\\"\\n\\nThen he asked the company, \\\"Just where have these missionary infants\\nbeen sent?\\\"\\n\\nNobody knew, exactly. They had the name of the town and the province,\\nbut the geography of China is not as yet familiar even to those who\\nsupport the missions and missionaries of that vast, mysterious land.\\n\\nThe pastor thought it was two or three hundred miles inland from\\nFoochow. \\\"Anyhow,\\\" said he, \\\"it is a good-sized town, of about one\\nhundred thousand people or more, and Joe's hospital is the only one in\\nthe whole district. The man whose place he takes is home on furlough,\\nand I've looked up his work in the Annual Report of the Foreign Missions\\nBoard. Six or eight years ago the hospital was a building of sun-dried\\nbrick, with a mud floor and accommodations for about seventy-five\\npatients. He was running it on something like five dollars a day. But it\\nis better now, costs more too. And there's a school attached, where\\nMarcia has already begun to make herself necessary, or I'm much\\nmistaken.\\\"\\n\\nSo the talk ran on, until the evening was far spent, and everybody\\nwished there could be half a dozen such evenings before J.W. must go\\nback to Saint Louis and the road.\\n\\nNo other opportunity offered, however, and all too soon for some people\\nJ.W. was gone again from Delafield.\\n\\nWalter Drury, seeing his chance, set himself to follow up the talk of\\nthat one evening. It had given him a lead as to the next phase of the\\nExperiment, and he wanted to try out the idea before anything else might\\nhappen.\\n\\nSo he wrote to his brother Albert in Saint Louis. \\\"I know I'm a bother\\nto you,\\\" the letter ran, \\\"but you have always been generous, being your\\nown unselfish self. It's about young Farwell, 'John Wesley, Jr.,' you\\nknow. I judge he's a boy with a fine business future, and I've found out\\nfrom his father some of the reasons why he is making good. Now, I don't\\nknow much about business, but it seems to me that the very qualities\\nwhich make J.W. a good salesman for a beginner would be profitable to\\nhis company if they sent him to their Oriental trade. He's young enough\\nto learn something over there. My own interest is not on that side of\\nthe affair, but I know it would be out of the question to suggest his\\ngoing unless the Cummings people could see a business advantage in it.\\nIf you think it is not asking too much, I wish you would talk to Mr.\\nMcDougall about it. Tell him what I have written, and what I told you\\nlong ago about J.W.\\\"\\n\\nAlbert Drury had unbounded confidence in his brother's sincerity and\\nsense, so he lost no time in getting an interview with his friend\\nMcDougall.\\n\\n\\\"See here, Peter,\\\" said he, \\\"I'll be frank with you; I know you think\\nI'd better be if I'm to get anywhere.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's very true,\\\" said McDougall, with assumed severity.\\n\\n\\\"Well, then, read my brother's letter; and then tell me if he's wanting\\nthe impossible.\\\"\\n\\nPeter McDougall read the letter twice. \\\"No,\\\" he said, when he handed it\\nback, \\\"he's not wanting the impossible. He's given me an idea. I owe you\\nsomething already, for finding this young fellow, and I'll tell you what\\nI'm thinking of. Of course the boy isn't seasoned enough yet, but he's\\ngetting there fast. A couple of long trips, a few months under my own\\neye here in the office, and he'll be ready. Now, your brother has hinted\\nat exactly what young Farwell is good for. That boy sells goods by\\ngetting over onto the buyer's side. And he knows tools--knew 'em before\\nwe hired him. Well, then, here's the idea; one big need of our foreign\\ntrade is to show our agencies what can really be done with American\\nhardware and tools. It takes more than a salesman; and Farwell has the\\nknack. So there you are. Tell your brother the boy shall have his\\nchance.\\\"\\n\\nA few months later McDougall sent for J.W. and put the whole proposal\\nbefore him.\\n\\n\\\"But I'm not an expert, Mr. McDougall,\\\" J.W. protested. \\\"I haven't the\\nexperience, and I might fall down completely in a new field like that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We're not looking for an expert,\\\" said McDougall, shortly. \\\"You know\\nwhat every user of our stuff ought to know; you can put yourself in his\\nplace; and you'll be a sort of missionary. How about it?\\\"\\n\\nAt the word J.W.'s memory awoke, and he heard again what had been said\\nin the living room at Delafield when he was last at home. A missionary!\\nAnd here was the very chance they had all talked about.\\n\\n\\\"Of course I should like to go, if you think I'll do,\\\" he said.\\n\\nPeter looked at him more kindly than was his wont. \\\"My boy,\\\" he said, \\\"I\\nknow something about you outside of business, though not much. And I\\nthink you'll do. Mind you, your missionary work will be tools and\\nhardware, not the Methodist Church. You will have to show people who\\nhave their own ideas about tools how much more convenient our goods are;\\nhandier, lighter, more adaptable. What they need over there is modern\\nstuff. It will help them to raise more crops and do better work and earn\\na better income. You've nothing to do with selling policies, finance,\\ncredits, and all that. Just be a tool and hardware missionary.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where had you thought of sending me?\\\" asked J.W., still somewhat\\ndazed.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, wherever we have agencies that you can use as bases: China, the\\nPhilippines, Malaysia, India. You will have to figure on a year or\\nnearly that. And you mustn't stick to the ports or the big cities. Get\\nhold of people who'll show you the country; the places where our goods\\nare most needed and least known. Study the people and their tools. Work\\nout better ways of doing things. Don't try to hustle the East, but\\nremember that the East is doing a little hustling on its own account\\nthese days. And talk turkey to our agencies--when you're sure you have\\nsomething to talk about.\\\"\\n\\nThe rest is detail. The trip determined on, preparations were hastened.\\nA month before the date of starting J.W. had time for no more than a\\nhurried visit to Delafield, to say good-by to the home folk and to the\\npreacher whom he had come to think of as Timothy might have thought of\\nPaul. Then he had something else to say to Jeannette. His prospects were\\nbecoming so promising that he could ask her a very definite question,\\nand he dared to hope for a definite answer.\\n\\nJeannette, troubled at the thought of his long absence in strange lands,\\nconsoled herself by her promise, which was his promise also. As soon as\\nhe came home again they would be married. Brother Drury should\\nofficiate, assisted by \\\"the Rev. Martin Luther Shenk, brother of the\\ncharming bride,\\\" as J.W. put it.\\n\\nWalter Drury was not his usual alert self, J.W. thought, and it hurt him\\nto see his much-loved friend touched even a little by the years. But\\nthe pastor brightened up, and grew visibly better as J.W. told him all\\nhis plans.\\n\\n\\\"Just think, Mr. Drury,\\\" he said with animation, \\\"I'm to be a\\nmissionary, after all. Once long ago I remember you suggested I might go\\nto China and see for myself the difference between their religion and\\nours; and now I'm going to China. Who knows, maybe I'll see Joe Carbrook\\nat his work. And then I'm to go all over the East, to preach the gospel\\nof better tools.\\\" Then he became thoughtful. \\\"Don't you think that's\\nalmost as good as the gospel of better bodies--Joe's gospel?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Surely, I do,\\\" said the pastor, \\\"if you and Joe preach in the same\\nspirit, knowing that China won't be saved even by hospitals and modern\\nhardware. They help. But remember our understanding; you have your\\nchance now to see the religions of the East. Going right among the\\npeople, as you will, you can find out more in a week than the average\\ntourist ever discovers. I'll give you the names of some people who will\\ngladly help you. And we shall want a full report when you come back. God\\nbless you, J.W.\\\"\\n\\nIt was a tired preacher who went to bed that night. This new adventure\\nof his boy's; what would it mean to the Experiment? He had done his best\\nto keep that long-ago pledge to himself. Not always had the project been\\neasy; he could not control all its circumstances, but in the main it had\\ngone well.\\n\\nAnd now J.W. was in the last stage of the Experiment Walter Drury had\\ncontrived to shape its larger conditions, with the help of many friendly\\nbut unsuspecting conspirators. This tour in the interest of better tools\\nwas due mainly to his initiative. But he could do nothing more. The\\nevent was now out of his hands. The relaxed tension made him realize\\nthat his nerves were shaky, and he had a sense of great depression. But\\nbefore he went to bed he pulled himself together long enough to write to\\nfive missionaries, including Joe Carbrook, whose fields were on or near\\nthe route J.W. would travel. He had told J.W. that he would let these\\nmen know of his coming, but he did more. To each one he said a word of\\nappeal. \\\"Don't argue much with this boy of mine; I want him to see it\\nwithout too many second-hand opinions. Explain all you please, and let\\nhim get as near as he can to the people you are dealing with. If, as I\\nhope, he gets a glimpse of the work's inner meaning, I shall be\\nsatisfied.\\\"\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nThe first day which J.W. spent in Shanghai was a big day for him. Even\\namid the strangeness of the scene he felt almost at home. The people who\\nhad the Cummings agency had received their instructions, and were\\nprepared to help him every way. He could begin an up-country trip at\\nonce if he wished. Then he met the first of the men to whom Pastor Drury\\nhad written, Mark Rutledge, and at once he saw that this well-groomed,\\nalert young missionary, who used modern speech in deliberate but direct\\nfashion, would be of immense service to him.\\n\\nRutledge received J.W.'s gospel of tools with almost boyish\\nenthusiasm. \\\"I've always said,\\\" he exclaimed, \\\"that if the other\\nbusiness men of America had as much sense as the tobacco folks they\\nwould hasten the Christianizing of China by many a year. Not that\\ntobacco is helping; far from it. But it's the idea of fitting their\\nproduct to this particular market. And your house has evidently caught\\nthat idea. You must have a real sales manager in Saint Louis! Of course\\nI'll help you all I can.\\\"\\n\\nSome of the help which Mark Rutledge gave him was of a sort that J.W.\\ncould not rightly estimate at the time, but he knew it was good. As long\\nas he stayed in Shanghai, and as often he came back to the city as a\\nbase, he and Rutledge were pretty frequently together. The missionary\\nkept his own counsel as to the Drury letter, merely dropping a hint now\\nand then, or a suggestion which fitted both the Cummings agency's\\nprogram and the pastor's desire.\\n\\nThe inland trips for business purposes kept J.W. busy for weeks; he\\nfound himself in so utterly novel a situation that he saw he could not\\nwork out anything without careful study and expert Chinese cooperation.\\nAs he came and went he saw, under Rutledge's guidance, much of the\\ninside of mission work. In Shanghai he found a Methodist publishing\\nhouse, sending out literature all over China, as well as two monthly\\npapers, one in Chinese and one in English. Many missionary boards had\\nheadquarters here. From Shanghai as a business center every form of\\nmissionary work was being promoted, reaching as far as the foothills of\\nthe Thibetan plateau. Hospital equipment was distributed, and school\\nequipment, and supplies of every variety. He saw that it was the\\nfinancial center too, and mission finance is a special science. Shanghai\\nseemed to J.W. to be one of the great capitals of the missionary world.\\n\\nRutledge's own work, many sided as J.W. saw it was, had two aspects of\\nspecial significance. Rutledge was sending back to America all the\\ninformation he could gather from the whole field. With the skill of a\\ntrained reporter he showed the missionaries how to write so as to make a\\ngenuine story seem convincing, and how to subordinate the details to the\\nimportance of making a clear and single impression.\\n\\nThe other work of Rutledge's which caught J.W.'s eye was his activity\\nin behalf of the young people of China. Until lately nothing at all had\\nbeen done comparable to the specialized development of young people's\\nwork in America, but now the Epworth League was beginning to be utilized\\nand adapted to Chinese ways. Funds were available--not much, but a\\nbeginning. Leaders were being trained. A larger measure of local,\\nChinese help was being employed.\\n\\nJ.W. asked Mark Rutledge about all this one day. \\\"Isn't it going to\\nmake a difference with the work by and by, if you get so many natives\\ninto places of responsibility? Are they ready for it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Rutledge, \\\"they're not. But we must make them ready. You\\nhaven't begun to see China yet, but already you can see that the\\ncountry could never be 'evangelized,' even in the narrowest use of that\\nword, by foreign missionaries. And it ought not to be.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You mean that we Americans ought to consider our work in China as\\ntemporary?\\\" J.W. asked.\\n\\nRutledge answered, \\\"Frankly, I do, if you let me put my own meaning into\\n'temporary,' We must start things. And much that must be done in the\\nlong run has not yet been started. We must stay here beyond my life\\nexpectation or yours. But China will be Christianized by the Chinese,\\nnot by foreigners. As far ahead as we can see the work will have help\\nfrom outside, but I honestly want the time to come when we missionaries\\nwill be looked upon as the foreign helpers of the Chinese Church; not,\\nas now, controlling the work ourselves and enlisting the services of\\n'native helpers.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then tell me another thing,\\\" J.W. persisted. \\\"Is our Christianity, as\\nthe Chinese get it, any advance on their own religion? Or is their\\nreligion all right, if they would work it as we hope they may work the\\nChristian program?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's two questions,\\\" said Rutledge, dryly, \\\"but, after all, it is\\nonly one. Our Christianity as the Chinese get it is far ahead of the\\nbest they have, in ideals, in human values, everything, even if they\\nwere more consistent in responding to its claims than Christians are.\\nThe old religions--and China has several--are helpless. We are not\\nkilling off the old faiths. If we should get out to-morrow these would\\nnone the less die out in time, but then China would be left without any\\nreligion at all. Instead, she's going to have the Christian faith in a\\nform that will accord with the genius of the Chinese mind. That's my\\nsure confidence, or I wouldn't be here.\\\"\\n\\nIt was necessary that J.W. should run down the coast to Foochow, the\\nbase for his next operations in the hardware adventure. \\\"I know I'm\\ngreen,\\\" he said to Rutledge, \\\"and I may be thinking of impossibilities,\\nbut do you suppose there'll be any chance for me to get up to Dr.\\nCarbrook's place from Foochow? I've told you about him and his wife, and\\nI'd rather see those two than anybody else in all the East.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's not impossible at all,\\\" Rutledge assured him. \\\"Carbrook's post is\\nnot so very far from Foochow, as distances go in China, and Ralph Bellew\\nat the college will help you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, my pastor at home told me to be sure and call on him,\\\" said J.W.,\\nand took his leave of a man he would long remember.\\n\\nThe call of Professor Bellew was not delayed long after J.W. had found\\nhis bearings in Foochow, and the Professor's welcome was even more\\ncordial than that of the Cummings agency, though these gentlemen were,\\nof course, the soul of courtesy. If they were not so sure as Peter\\nMcDougall that J.W. or any other American could teach them anything\\nabout selling the Cummings line in China, at least they would not put\\nanything in his way.\\n\\nOne important interior town, Yenping, they had hoped J.W. might visit,\\nbut unfortunately there was no one connected with the agency who could\\nbe sent with him. They understood that some of his missionary friends\\nwere ready to help him in the general enterprise, and perhaps they might\\nbe able to suggest something.\\n\\nWhen the difficulty was stated to Professor Bellew he said: \\\"Why, that's\\none of our stations. It is a little out of the way to go up to Dr.\\nCarbrook's place on the way to Yenping, but we'll see that you get to\\nboth towns.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's certainly good of you, Professor,\\\" said J.W., gratefully. \\\"I've\\ntold you about Joe Carbrook, and I can hardly wait until I get to him.\\\"\\nAs a matter of fact, he had told everybody about Joe Carbrook.\\n\\nProfessor Bellew was sympathetic. \\\"I know,\\\" he said, \\\"and I understand.\\nWhen you come back, if we can manage the dates, you may find something\\nhere which you ought to see.\\\"\\n\\nThe Carbrook Hospital--it has another name in the annual reports, but\\nthis will identify it sufficiently for our purposes--spread itself all\\nover the compound and beyond in its welcome to J.W. Joe and Marcia were\\nfirst, and joyfullest. The school turned out to the last scholar, and\\neven the hospital's \\\"walking cases\\\" insisted on having a share in the\\nwelcome to the foreign doctor's friend.\\n\\n\\\"Tell us what you are up to,\\\" said the Carbrooks, when they were back in\\nthe house after a sketchy inspection of the whole establishment;\\nhospital, dispensary, school, chapel, and so forth. And, \\\"Tell me what\\nyou are doing with it, now that you have the hospital you have been\\ndreaming about so long,\\\" said J.W.\\n\\nBut J.W. told his story first, just to get it out of the way, as he\\nsaid. Then he turned to Marcia and said, \\\"How about it, 'Mrs.\\nCarbrook'?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, J.W.,\\\" said Marcia, \\\"that name is not so strange as it was. I'm\\nfeeling as if I had been married a long time, judging by the\\nresponsibilities, that are dumped on me just because I am the doctor's\\nwife. And this doctor man of mine hardly knows whether to be happy or\\nmiserable. He's happy, because he has found the very place he wanted.\\nAnd he's miserable because he ought to be learning the language and\\ncan't get away from the work that crowds in on him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you yourself, Marcia,\\\" J.W. asked, \\\"are you happy or miserable, or\\nboth?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She's as mixed up as I am, old man,\\\" Joe answered for her. \\\"Talk about\\nthe language! I don't hanker after learning it, but I've got to, some\\ntime. If they would just let me be a sort of deaf-mute doctor I'd be\\nmuch obliged. The work is fairly maddening. You know, it was a question\\nof closing up this hospital or putting me in as a green hand. Of course\\nthere are the nurses, and a couple of students. But I'm glad they put me\\nin; only, look at the job! Never a day without new patients. A steady\\nstream at the out-clinic. Why, J.W., I've done operations alone here\\nthat at home they'd hardly let me hold sponges for. Had to do 'em.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" J.W. commented, \\\"isn't that what you came for?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is,\\\" Marcia answered--these two had a queer way of speaking for each\\nother--\\\"and it would be a good plenty if the hospital were all. But we\\nare putting up a new building to take the place of an adobe horror, and\\nJoe has to buy bricks and deal with workmen and give advice and dispense\\nmedicine and do operations, all with the help of a none too sure\\ninterpreter. He's the busiest man, I do believe, between here and\\nFoochow.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. wanted to draw Dr. Joe out about the work in general. What of the\\nevangelistic work, and the educational work, and all the rest.\\n\\nBut Dr. Joe would not rise to it. \\\"I'll tell you honestly, J.W., I just\\ndon't know. Haven't had time to find out. When I got here I found people\\nstanding three deep around the hospital doors, some wanting help for\\nthemselves, and some anxious to bring relatives or friends. I was at\\nwork before anything was unpacked except my instruments. And I've been\\nat it ever since. Everything else could wait, but all this human misery\\ncouldn't. And I don't know much of what the evangelistic value of it all\\nwill be. We have a Bible woman and a teacher in the school who are very\\ndevoted. They read and pray every day with the patients, and as for\\ngratitude, I never expected to be thanked for what I did as I have been\\nthanked here. I'll tell you one thing; I didn't dream a man could be so\\ncontent in the midst of such a hurricane of work. I'm done to a\\nstandstill every day; I bump into difficulties and tackle\\nresponsibilities that I hadn't even heard of in medical school, though I\\nhaven't killed anybody yet. And all the time I remember how I used to\\nwish I might be the only doctor between Siam and sunrise. I'm plenty\\nnear enough to that, in all conscience. The only doctor in this town of\\none hundred thousand, and a district around us so big that I'm afraid to\\nmeasure it. On one side the next doctor is a good hundred miles away.\\nNow, do you know how I feel? Oh, yes; insufficient until it hurts like\\nthe toothache, yet somehow as though I were carrying on here, not in\\nplace of the man who has gone home on furlough, but in place of Jesus\\nChrist himself. You know I'm not irreverent; I might have been, but this\\nhas taken all of the temptation out of me. It is his work, not mine.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. turned to Marcia again. \\\"I thought you said this Joe of yours was\\nmiserable, I've seen him when he was enjoying himself pretty well, but I\\nnever saw him like this.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know,\\\" Marcia admitted, \\\"and I didn't mean he was really unhappy. But\\nit is a big strain, and there's no sign of its letting up until the\\nregular doctor gets back.\\\"\\n\\nThe next day J.W. watched his old friend amid the press of duties which\\ncrowded the hours, and he marveled as much as the wretchedness of the\\npatients as he did at the steady resourcefulness of the man whom he had\\nknown when he was Delafield's adventurous and spendthrift idler.\\n\\nAs he looked on, J.W. could understand something which had been a closed\\nbook to him before. No one could stand by and see this abjectness of\\nneed, this helplessness, this pathetic faith which was almost fatalistic\\nin the foreign doctor's miraculous powers--it recalled that beseeching\\ncry in the New Testament story, \\\"Lord, if thou _wilt_ thou\\n_canst_\\\"--without being deeply, poignantly glad that there were such men\\nas Joe Carbrook. It was all very well to talk at long range about\\nletting China and other places wait. But on the spot nobody could talk\\nthat way.\\n\\nThe visit might have lasted two weeks, instead of two days, and then the\\nCarbrooks would have hung on and besought him to stay a little longer.\\nTorture would not have drawn any admission from them, but back of all\\nthe joy in the work was a something that left them without words as J.W.\\nand his little group from Foochow set out for the next stopping place.\\nJust before the last silent hand-grips, J.W. told his friends about\\nJeannette and himself, and promised Joe a wedding present. \\\"You see,\\\" he\\nsaid, \\\"I never sent you one when you were married, and I'd like to send\\nyou a double one now, for yourselves and for us. You send me word what\\nit is you most need for the hospital, an X-ray outfit, or a sterilizer,\\nor a thingamajig for making cultures, microscope included, and Jeannette\\nand I will see that you get it. I'm a tither, you know, and my salary's\\nbeen raised, and I want to do something to show what a fool I was before\\nI knew what sort of a business you were really in out here. So don't be\\nmodest; you can't hurt my feelings!\\\"\\n\\nBack at Foochow in the course of the slow days which Chinese travel\\ngives to those who go aside from the beaten path, Professor Bellew\\nwelcomed J.W. with eager warmth. \\\"You're back just in time, if you can\\nstay a few days; the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the\\ncollege begins to-morrow.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. had at least a week's business with the Cummings agents. He had\\nfound some conditions on his inland journey which called for much\\ndiscussion. So he had time for sharing in a good deal of the\\ncelebration. It was something to marvel at, that a Christian college had\\nbeen at work in this great city for forty years.\\n\\nThe president of the college and his wife started the proceedings with a\\nformal reception, at which a Chinese orchestra furnished music outside\\nthe house, and Western musicians rendered more familiar selections in\\nthe parlors. Alumni flocked to the reception, men of every variety of\\noccupation, but all one in their devotion to their Alma Mater. The next\\nafternoon was given over to athletics, and the evening to a lecture,\\nquite in the American fashion.\\n\\nThe third day being Sunday, J.W. listened to an American missionary in\\nthe morning, who spoke boldly of the prime need for a college like this\\nif the youth of China were to be trained for the highest service to\\ntheir country. At night he sat through nearly three hours of the most\\namazing testimony meeting he had ever seen. It was led by a Chinese who\\nhad been graduated from the college thirty years before. The eagerness,\\nalmost impatience, to confess what Jesus Christ and Christian education\\nhad meant to these Chinese leaders--for it was evident they _were_\\nleaders--was a thing to stir the most sluggish Christian pulse. J.W.'s\\nmind took him back to a memorable love feast at Cartwright Institute,\\nwhen Joe Carbrook had made his first confession of and surrender to\\nJesus Christ, and it seemed to him that the likeness between these two\\nso different gatherings was far more real than all their contrasts.\\n\\nOn Monday the anniversary banquet brought the American consul, a\\nrepresentative of the provincial governor, and many other dignitaries.\\nAnd on Tuesday the students put on a pageant which illustrated in\\ngorgeousness of color and costume and accessories the history of the\\ncollege. Besides all this pomp and circumstance there was a wonderful\\nindustrial exhibit. The president of China sent a scroll, as did also\\nthe prime minister. Former students in the cities of China, from Peking\\nto Amoy, sent subscriptions amounting to twenty-five thousand dollars\\nfor new buildings, and other old students in the Philippines sent a\\nsecond twenty-five thousand dollars.\\n\\nAll of which stirred J.W. to the very soul. Here was a Christian college\\nolder than many in America. Its results could not be measured by any\\nvisible standards, yet he had seen graduates of the school and students\\nwho did not stay long enough to graduate, men of light and leading, men\\nof wealth and station, officials, men in whom the spirit of the new\\nChina burned, Christian workers; and all these bore convincing testimony\\nthat this college had been the one great mastering influence of their\\nlives. A Christian college--in China!\\n\\nJ.W. thought of it all and said to himself: \\\"I wonder if I am the same\\nindividual as he who not so many months ago was talking about the good\\nsense of letting China wait indefinitely for Christ? Anyhow, somebody\\nhas had better sense than that every day of the last forty years!\\\"\\n\\nThe \\\"tour of the tools\\\" was teaching J.W. more than he could teach the\\nmerchants of Asia. And yet he was doing no little missionary work, as\\nevidenced both in his own reports to Peter McDougall, and still more in\\nthe reports which went to that observant gentleman after J.W. had moved\\non from any given place. The Cummings Hardware Corporation may be\\nwithout a soul, as corporations are known to be, but it has many eyes.\\n\\nThese eyes followed J.W.'s progress from Shanghai to Foochow, to Hong\\nKong, to Manila. They observed how he studied artisans and their ways\\nwith tools, and the ways of builders with house fittings, and the\\nvarious devices with which in field and garden the toilers set\\nthemselves to their endless labor. As the eyes of the Cummings\\norganization saw these things, the word went back across the water to\\nSaint Louis, and Peter McDougall took credit to himself for a\\ncommendable shrewdness.\\n\\nBut the ever-watchful eyes had no instructions to report on the tool\\nmissionary's other activities, and therefore no report was made. None\\nthe less they saw, and wondered, and thought that there was something\\nback of it all. There was more back of it than they could have guessed.\\n\\nFor J.W. had come to a new zest for both of his quests. The business\\nwhich had brought him into the East was daily becoming more fascinating\\nin its possibilities and promise. In even greater measure the interests\\nwhich belong especially to this chronicle were taking on a new\\nimportance. Everywhere he went he sought out the missions and the\\nmissionaries. He plied the workers with question on question until they\\ntold him all the hopes and fears and needs and longings which often they\\nhesitated to put into their official letters to the Boards.\\n\\nIn Manila he saw, after a little more than two decades of far from\\ncomplete missionary occupation, the signs that a Christian civilization\\nwas rising. The schools and churches and hospitals and other\\norganization work established in Manila were proof that all through the\\nislands the everyday humdrum of missionary service was going forward,\\nperhaps without haste, but surely without rest.\\n\\nWhen he came to Singapore, that traffic corner to which all the sea\\nroads of the East converge, he heard the story of a miracle, and then\\nhe saw the miracle itself, the Anglo-Chinese College.\\n\\nThey told him what it meant, not the missionaries only, but the Chinese\\nmerchants who controlled the Cummings line for all the archipelago, and\\nSumatra planters, and British officials, and business men from Malaysian\\ntrade centers whose names he had never before heard.\\n\\nThe teacher who put himself at J.W.'s service was one of the men to\\nwhom Pastor Drury had written his word of appeal on J.W.'s behalf. He\\nrespected it altogether, and the more because he well knew that here was\\nno need for mere talk. A visitor with eyes and ears could come to his\\nown conclusions. If the college were not its own strongest argument, no\\nwords could strengthen it.\\n\\nThe college had been started by intrepid men who had no capital but\\nfaith and an overmastering sense of duty. That was a short generation\\nago. Now J.W. saw crowded halls and students with purposeful faces, and\\nhe heard how, at first by the hundreds and now by thousands, the product\\nof this school was spreading a sense of Christian life-values through\\nall the vast island and ocean spaces from Rangoon to New Guinea, and\\nfrom Batavia to Sulu.\\n\\nBut it may as well be told that, even more than China, India made the\\ndeepest impress on the mind and heart of our tool-traveler. From the\\nmoment when he landed in Calcutta to the moment when he watched the low\\ncoasts of the Ganges delta merge into the horizon far astern, India\\nwould not let him alone. He saw poverty such as could scarcely be\\ndescribed, and religious rites the very telling of which might sear the\\ntongue. If China's poor had a certain apathy which seemed like poise,\\neven in their wretchedness, not so India's, but, rather, a slow-moving\\nmisery, a dull progress toward nothing better, with only nothingness and\\nits empty peace at last.\\n\\nOnce in Calcutta, and his business plans set going, he started out to\\nfind some of the city's Christian forces. They were not easy to find. As\\nin every Oriental city, missionary work is relatively small. Indeed, J.\\nW. began to think that this third city of Asia had little religion of\\nany sort.\\n\\nHe had been prepared in part for the first meager showing of mission\\nwork. On shipboard he had encountered the usual assortment of missionary\\ncritics; the unobservant, the profane, the superior, the loose-living,\\nand all that tribe. The first of them he had met on the second day out\\nfrom San Francisco, and every boat which sailed the Eastern seas\\nappeared to carry its complement of self-appointed and all-knowing\\nenemies of the whole missionary enterprise. While steaming up the Bay of\\nBengal, the anti-mission chorus appeared at its critical best. J.W. was\\ntold as they neared Calcutta that the Indian Christian was servile, and\\nslick and totally untrustworthy. Never had these expert observers seen a\\ngenuine convert, but only hypocrites, liars, petty thieves, and\\ngrafters.\\n\\nIn spite of it all, at last he found the Methodist Mission, and it was\\nnot so small, when once you saw the whole of it. By great good fortune\\nhis instructions from home ordered him up country as far as Cawnpore.\\nAnd to his delight he met a Methodist bishop, one of the new ones, who\\nwas setting out with a party for the Northwest. So, on the bishop's most\\ncordial invitation, he joined himself to the company, and learned in a\\nday or two from experts how to make the best of India's rather trying\\ntravel conditions.\\n\\nBenares, Allahabad, Cawnpore, Lucknow--J.W. came to these cities with a\\nqueer feeling of having been there before. Long ago, in his early Sunday\\nschool days, the names of these places and the wonders of them had been\\nthe theme of almost the only missionary book he had at that age cared to\\nread.\\n\\nAt Allahabad, said his companions of the way, an All-India Epworth\\nLeague convention was to be held, and J.W. made up his mind that a\\nLeague convention in India would be doubly worth attending. He did\\nattend it too, but it left no such memory as another gathering in the\\nsame city; a memory which he knows will last after every other picture\\nof the East has faded from his recollection.\\n\\nThe party had reached Allahabad at the time of the Khumb Mela, a vast\\noutpouring of massed humanity too great for any but the merest guesses\\nat its numbers. This \\\"Mela,\\\" feast, religious pilgrimage, whatever it\\nmight mean to these endless multitudes, is held here at stated times\\nbecause the two sacred rivers, the Jumna and the Ganges, come together\\nat Allahabad, and tradition has it that a third river flows beneath the\\nsurface to meet the others. So the place is trebly sacred, its waters\\npotent for purification, no matter how great one's sin.\\n\\nWith the others J.W. set out for an advantageous observation point, on\\nthe wall of the fort which stands on the tongue of land between the two\\nstreams. On the way J.W. assured himself that if Calcutta seemed without\\nreligion, here was more than enough of it to redress the balances. In\\nthe throng was a holy man whose upraised arm had been held aloft until\\nit had atrophied, and would never more swing by his side. And yonder\\nanother holy one sat in the sand, with a circle of little fires burning\\nclose about him. The seeker after he knew not what who made his search\\nwhile lying on a bed of spikes was here. And once a procession passed,\\ntwo hundred men, all holy after the fashion of Hindu holiness, all\\nutterly naked, with camels and elephants moving in their train. As if to\\nshow how these were counted men of special sanctity, the people fell on\\ntheir faces to the ground beside them as they passed, and kissed their\\nshadows on the sand.\\n\\nThe point of vantage reached, J.W.'s bewildered eyes could scarce make\\nhis brain believe what they saw. He was standing on a broad wall, thirty\\nfeet above the water, and perhaps a hundred feet back from it. Up and\\ndown the stream was an endless solid mass of heads. J.W. looked for some\\nbreak in the crowd, some thinning out of its packed bodies, but as far\\nas he could see there was no break, no end. Government officials had\\nestimated the number of pilgrims at two millions!\\n\\nA signal must have been given, or an hour had come--J.W. could not tell\\nwhich--but somehow the people knew that now was the opportunity to enter\\nthe water and gain cleansing from all sin. A mighty, resistless movement\\ncarried the human stream to meet the river. Inevitably the weaker\\nindividuals were swept along helpless, and those who fell arose no more.\\nHorrified, J.W. stood looking down on the slow, irresistible movement\\nof the writhing bodies, and he saw a woman drop. A British police\\nofficer, standing in an angle of the wall beneath, ordered a native\\npoliceman to get the woman out But the native, seeing the crush and\\nunwilling to risk himself for so slight a cause, waited until his\\nsuperior turned away to another point of peril, and then, snatching the\\nred-banded police turban from his head, was lost in the general mass.\\n\\nThe woman? Trampled to death, and twenty other men and women with her,\\nin sight of the stunned watchers on the wall, who were compelled to see\\nthese lives crushed out, powerless to help by so much as a finger's\\nweight.\\n\\nWhat was it all for? J.W. asked his companions on the wall. And they\\nsaid that the word went out at certain times and the people flocked to\\nthis Mela. They came to wash in the sacred waters at the propitious\\nmoment. Nothing else mattered; not the inescapable pollution of the\\nrivers, not the weariness and hunger and many distresses of the way. It\\nwas a chance, so the wise ones declared, to be rid of sin. Certainly it\\nmight not avail, but who would not venture if mayhap there might be\\ncleansing of soul in the waters of Mother Ganges?\\n\\nOn another day J.W. came to a temple, not a great towering shrine, but\\na third-rate sort of place, a sacred cow temple. Here was a family which\\nhad journeyed four hundred miles to worship before the idols of this\\ntemple. They offered rice to one idol, flowers to another, holy water\\nfrom the river to a third. No one might know what inner urge had driven\\nthem here. The priest, slow to heed them, at length deigned to dip his\\nfinger in a little paint and with it he smeared the caste mark on the\\nforeheads of the worshipers. It was heartless, empty formality.\\n\\nJ.W. watched the woman particularly. Her face was an unrelieved\\nsadness; she had fulfilled the prescribed rites, in the appointed place,\\nbut there was no surcease from the endless round of dull misery which\\nshe knew was her ordained lot. Thought J.W.: \\\"I suppose this is a sort\\nof joining the church, an initiation or something of that sort. Not much\\nlike what happened when I joined the church in Delafield. Everybody was\\nglad there; here nobody is glad, not even the priest.\\\"\\n\\nAt Cawnpore J.W. was able to combine business with his missionary\\ninquiries. Here he found great woollen and cotton mills, not unlike\\nthose of America, except that in these mills women and children were\\nworking long hours, seven days a week, for a miserable wage. It was\\nheathenism plus commercialism; that is to say, a double heathenism. For\\nwhen business is not tempered by the Christian spirit, it is as pagan as\\nany cow temple.\\n\\nIn these mills was a possible market for certain sorts of Cummings\\ngoods, as J.W. learned in the business quarter of the city. He wanted\\nmore opportunity to see how the goods he dealt in could be used, and,\\nhaving by now learned the path of least resistance, he appealed to a\\nmissionary. It was specially fortunate that he did, for the missionary\\nintroduced him to the secretary of the largest mills in the city, an\\nIndian Christian with a history.\\n\\nNow, this is a hint at the story of--well, let us call him Abraham. His\\nown is another Bible name, of more humble associations, but he deserves\\nto be called Abraham. Thirty years ago a missionary first evangelized\\nand then baptized some two hundred villagers--outcasts, untouchables,\\nsocial lepers. Being newly become Christians, they deposed their old\\nvillage god. The landlord beat them and berated them, but they were done\\nwith the idol. Now, that was no easy adventure of faith, and those who\\nthus adventured could not hope for material gain. They were more\\ndespised than ever.\\n\\nYet inevitably they began to rise in the human scale. The missionary\\nfound one of them a young man of parts. Him he took and taught to read,\\nto write, to know the Scriptures. He began to be an exhorter; then a\\nlocal preacher; and at last he joined the Conference as a Methodist\\nitinerant at six dollars a month. Now this boy was the father of\\nAbraham.\\n\\nAs a preacher he opened village schools, and taught the children their\\nletters, his own boy among them. Abraham learned quickly. A place was\\nfound for him in a mission boarding school. Thence he moved on and up to\\nLucknow Christian College. It was this man who escorted J.W. through the\\ngreat mills of which he was an executive. He had a salary of two hundred\\ndollars a month. If his father had been an American village preacher at\\ntwelve hundred dollars a year, Abraham's salary, relatively, would need\\nto be twenty or thirty thousand dollars.\\n\\nAbraham was the superintendent of a Sunday school in Cawnpore. He was\\ngiving himself to all sorts of betterment work which would lessen the\\nmisery of the poor. He had a seat in the city council. A hostel for boys\\nwas one of his enterprises. Here was a man doing his utmost to\\nChristianize the industry in which thousands of his country men spent\\ntheir lives; a second-generation Christian, and a man who must be\\nreckoned with, no longer spurned and despised as a casteless nobody.\\n\\nJ.W. followed Abraham about the mills with growing admiration. Inside\\nthe walls, light, orderly paths, flowers, cleanliness. Outside the gate,\\nto step across the road was to walk a thousand years into the past,\\namong the smells and the ageless noises of the bazaar, with its\\nchaffering and cheating, its primitive crudities, and its changeless\\nwares. Certainly, a Cawnpore mill is not the ideal industrial\\ncommonwealth, but without men like Abraham to alleviate its grimness the\\ncoming of larger opportunities through work like this might well lay a\\nheavier burden on men's lives than the primitive and costly toil which\\nit has displaced.\\n\\nThere was just time for a visit to Lucknow, a city which to the British\\nis the historic place of mutiny and siege; to American Methodists a\\nplace both of history and of present-day advance. J.W. worshiped in the\\ngreat Hindustani Methodist church, the busy home of many activities. In\\nthe congregation were many students, girls from Isabella Thoburn\\nCollege, and boys from Lucknow Christian College. Lifelong Methodist as\\nhe was, J.W. quickly recognized, even amid these new surroundings, the\\nfamiliar aspects of a Methodist church on its busy day. The crowding\\ncongregations were enough to stir one's blood. A noble organ sounded out\\nthe call to worship and led the choir and people in the service of\\npraise. There was a Sunday school in full operation, and an Epworth\\nLeague Chapter, completely organized and active. His guide confided to\\nJ.W. that this church had yet another point of resemblance to the great\\nchurches at home; it was quite accustomed to sending a committee to\\nConference, to tell the bishop whom it wanted for preacher next year!\\n\\nJ.W. was not quite satisfied. The days of his wanderings must soon be\\nover, but before he left India he wanted to see the missionary in actual\\ncontact with the immemorial paganism of the villages, for he had\\ndiscovered that the village is India. How was the Christian message\\nmeeting all the dreary emptinesses and limitations of village life?\\n\\nOnce more he appealed to his missionary guide; this latest one, the last\\nof the five men to whom Pastor Drury had written before J.W. had set out\\non his travels. Could he show his visitor a little of missionary work in\\nvillage environment?\\n\\n\\\"Surely. Nothing easier,\\\" the district superintendent said. \\\"We'll jump\\ninto my Ford--great thing for India, the Ford; and still greater for us\\nmissionaries--and we'll go a-villaging.\\\"\\n\\nThe village of their quest once reached, the Ford drew up before a neat\\nbrick house built around three sides of a courtyard, with verandas on\\nthe court side. This was no usual mud hut, but a house, and a parsonage\\nwithal. Here lived the Indian village preacher and his family. The\\npreacher's wife was neatly dressed and capable; the children clean and\\nwell-mannered. The room had its table, and on the table books. That\\nmeant nothing to J.W., but the superintendent gave him to understand\\nthat a table with books in an Indian village house was comparable in its\\nrarity to a small-town American home with a pipe organ and a butler!\\n\\nThe lunch of native food seemed delicious, if it was \\\"hot,\\\" to J.W.'s\\nhealthy appetite, and if he had not seen over how tiny a fire it had\\nbeen prepared he would have credited the smiling housewife with a\\nlavishly equipped kitchen.\\n\\nPeople began to drop in. It was somewhat disconcerting to the visitor,\\nto see these callers squatting on their heels, talking one to another,\\nbut watching him continually out of the corners of their eyes. One of\\nthem, the chaudrie, headman of the village, being introduced to J.W.,\\ntold him, the superintendent acting as interpreter, how the boys' school\\nflourished, and how he and other Christians had gone yesterday on an\\nevangelizing visit to another village, not yet Christian, but sure to\\nask for a teacher soon.\\n\\nThe preacher, in a rather precise, clipped English, asked J.W. if he\\ncared to walk about the village. \\\"We could go to the _mohulla_ [ward],\\nwhere most of our Christians live. They will be most glad to welcome\\nyou.\\\"\\n\\nThe way led through dirty, narrow streets, or, rather, let us say,\\nthrough the spaces between dwellings, to the low-caste quarter. Here\\nwere people of the bottom stratum of Indian life, yet it was a Christian\\ncommunity in the making. The little school was in session--a group of\\nfifteen or twenty boys and girls with their teacher. It was all very\\ncrude, but the children read their lessons for the visitor, and did sums\\non the board, and sang a hymn which the pastor had composed, and recited\\nthe Lord's Prayer and the Twenty-third psalm.\\n\\n\\\"These,\\\" said the pastor, \\\"are the children of a people which for a\\nthousand years has not known how to read or write. Yet see how they\\nlearn.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" the superintendent agreed, \\\"but that isn't the best of it, as you\\nknow. They are untouchables now, but even caste, which is stronger than\\ndeath, yields to education. Once these boys and girls have an education\\nthey cannot be ignored or kept down. They will find a place in the\\nsocial order.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can see that,\\\" J.W. said, thinking of Abraham. \\\"But education is not\\na missionary monopoly, is it? If these children were educated by Hindus,\\nwould not the resulting rise in their condition come just the same?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It would, perhaps,\\\" the missionary answered, \\\"but your 'if' is too big.\\nFor the low caste and the out-caste people there is no education unless\\nit is Christian education. We have a monopoly, though not of our\\nchoosing. The educated Hindu will not do this work under any\\ncircumstances. It has been tried, with all the prestige of the\\ngovernment, which is no small matter in India, and nothing comes of it.\\nNot long ago the government proposed a wonderful scheme for the\\neducation of the 'depressed classes.' The money was provided, and the\\nequipment as well. There were plenty of Hindus, that is, non-Christians,\\nwho were indebted to the government for their education. They were\\ninvited to take positions in the new schools. But no; not for any money\\nor any other inducement would these teachers go near. And there you are.\\nI know of no way out for the great masses of India except as the gospel\\nopens the door.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is there no attempt of any sort on the part of Indians who are not\\nChristians? Surely, some of them are enlightened enough to see the need,\\nand to rise above caste.\\\" J.W. suspected he was asking a question\\nwhich had but one answer.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, there is such an effort occasionally,\\\" the superintendent\\nadmitted. \\\"The Arya Samaj movement makes an attempt once in a while, but\\nit always fails. If a few are bold enough to disregard caste, they are\\nnever enough to do anything that counts. The effort is scarcely more\\nthan a gesture, and even so it would not have been made but for the\\nactivities of the missionaries.\\\"\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nAnd so ended J.W.'s Indian studies. Before many days he was retracing\\nhis way--Calcutta, Singapore, Hongkong, Shanghai, Yokohama. And then on\\na day he found himself aboard a liner whose prow turned eastward from\\nJapan's great port, and his heart was flying a homeward-bound pennant\\nthe like of which never trailed from any masthead.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHIS EXPERIMENT TEACHETH--?\\n\\nFor the first day or so out from Japan J.W. behaved himself as does any\\nordinary American in similar case; all the sensations of the journey\\nwere swallowed up in the depths of his longings to be home. The voyage\\nso slow; the Pacific so wide!\\n\\nBut shortly he resigned himself to the pervading restfulness of\\nshipboard, and began to make acquaintances. Of them all one only has any\\ninterest for us--Miss Helen Morel, late of Manila. Her place was next\\nto his at the table. Like J.W., she was traveling alone, and before they\\nhad been on board twenty-four hours they had discovered that both were\\nMethodists; he, from Delafield in the Middle West, she from\\nPennsylvania. J.W. found, altogether to his surprise, that she listened\\nwith flattering attention while he talked. For J.W. is no braggart, nor\\nis he overmuch given to self-admiration; we know him better than that.\\nBut it was pleasant, none the less, on good days to walk up and down the\\nlong decks, and on other days to sit in comfortable deck chairs, with\\nnothing to do but talk.\\n\\nMiss Morel, being a teacher going home after three years of steady,\\nclose work in a Manila high school, was ready to talk of anything but\\nschool work. She found herself immensely interested in J.W.'s\\nexperiences. He had told her of the double life, so to say, which he\\nhad led; preaching the good news of better tools, and studying the work\\nof other men and women, as truly salesmen as himself, who preached a\\nmore arresting and insistent gospel.\\n\\n\\\"I'm glad to meet some one who knows about missions at first hand,\\\" Miss\\nMorel began one morning, as they stepped out on the promenade deck for\\ntheir constitutional. \\\"You know, I think people at home don't understand\\nat all. They are so absorbed with their little parish affairs that they\\ncan't appreciate this wonderful work that is being done so far from\\nhome.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. agreed, though not without mental reservations. He knew how true\\nit was that many of the home folks did not rightly value mission work,\\nbut he was not so sure about their \\\"little parish affairs.\\\" He watched\\nto see if Miss Morel meant to expand that idea.\\n\\nBut she evidently had thought at once of something else. Said she,\\n\\\"Sometimes I think that if the gossip about missionaries and missions\\nwhich is so general in the Orient gets back home, as it surely does in\\none way or another, it must have a certain influence on what people\\nthink about the work.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, that,\\\" said J.W., with no little scorn. \\\"That stuff is always\\nignorant or malicious, and I doubt if it gets very far with church\\npeople. Of course it may with outsiders. I've heard it, any amount of\\nit; you can't miss it if you travel in the East And there's just enough\\nexcuse for it to make it a particularly vicious sort of slander. You\\ncould say as much about the churches at home, and a case here and there\\nwould not be lacking to furnish proof.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly,\\\" said the teacher. \\\"And yet missions are so wonderful; so\\nmuch more worth while than anything that is being done at home, don't\\nyou think?\\\"\\n\\nThere it was again. \\\"I'm afraid I don't follow you, Miss Morel,\\\" J.W.\\nsaid, with a puzzled air. \\\"Do you mean that the churches at home are not\\nonto their job, if you'll excuse the phrase?\\\"\\n\\nHis companion laughed as she answered, \\\"Maybe not quite as strong as\\nthat. But they are doing the same old thing in the same old way. Going\\nto church and home again, to Sunday school and home again, to young\\npeople's meeting and home again. But out here,\\\" and her hand swung in a\\nhalf circle as though she meant to include the whole Pacific basin, \\\"out\\nhere men and women are doing such splendid pioneer work, in all sorts of\\nfascinating ways.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"True enough,\\\" J.W. assented. \\\"I've seen that, all right. But the home\\nchurch isn't so dead as you might think. Just before I left Delafield to\\ngo to Saint Louis, for instance, a new work for the foreign-speaking\\npeople of our town was being started, with the Board of Home Missions\\nand Church Extension backing up the local workers. They were planning to\\nmake a great church center for all these people, and I hear that it is\\ngetting a good start.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, I can well believe that, Mr. Farwell,\\\" Miss Morel hastened to\\nsay. \\\"I think work for the immigrant is so very interesting, don't you?\\nBut, of course, that's not quite what I meant. The usual dull things\\nthat churches do, you know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, take another instance that I happen to remember,\\\" J.W. had a\\ntouch of the sort of feeling he used to delight in at Cartwright, when\\nhe was gathering his material for a debate. \\\"My first summer after\\nleaving college, a few of us in First Church got busy studying our own\\ntown. We found two of the general church boards ready to help us with\\nfacts and methods. The Home Missions people gave us one sort of help,\\nand another board, with the longest name of them all, the Board of\\nTemperance, Prohibition, and Public Morals, showed us how to go about an\\ninvestigation of the town's undesirable citizens and their influence. It\\nis in that sort of business for all of us, you know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That must have been exciting,\\\" said Miss Morel. \\\"I know I should enjoy\\nsuch work. What did you find out, and what could you do about it?\\\"\\n\\nThat was a question not to be glibly answered, J.W. knew. But he meant\\nto be fair about it. \\\"We found out plenty that surprised us; a great\\ndeal,\\\" he added, \\\"that ought to be done, and much more that needed to be\\nchanged. We even went so far as to draw up a sort of civic creed, 'The\\nEveryday Doctrines of Delafield,' The town paper printed it, and it was\\ntalked about for a while, but probably we were the people who got the\\nmost out of it; it showed us what we church members might mean to the\\ntown. And that was worth something.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Morel was sure it was. But she came back to her first idea about\\nthe home churches. \\\"Don't you think that much of the preaching, and all\\nthat, is pretty dull and tiresome? I came from a little country church,\\nand it was so dreary.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. thought of Deep Creek, and said, \\\"I know what you mean; but even\\nthe country church is improving. I must tell you some time about Marty,\\nmy chum. He's a country preacher, helped in his training by the Rural\\nDepartment of the Home Missions Board, and his people come in crowds to\\nhis preaching. Country churches are waking up, and the Board people at\\nPhiladelphia have had a lot to do with it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I'm glad. But anyway, home missions is rather commonplace,\\nhaven't you noticed?\\\" and Miss Morel looked almost as though she were\\nasking a question of state.\\n\\n\\\"I can't say I've found it so,\\\" J.W. said, stoutly, \\\"I was some time\\nlearning, but I ran into a lot of experiences before I left home. Take\\nthe work for colored people, for instance. I had to make a speech at a\\nconvention, and I found out that our church has a Board of Education for\\nNegroes which is doing more than any other agency to train Negro\\npreachers and teachers and home makers, and doctors and other leaders.\\nThat's not so very commonplace, would you say so?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, no,\\\" the young lady admitted. \\\"It is very important work, of\\ncourse; and I'd dearly love to have a share in it. I am a great\\nbeliever in the colored races, you know. But you are making me begin to\\nthink I am all wrong about the church at home. I don't mean to belittle\\nit. Perhaps I appreciate it more than I realized. Anyway, tell me\\nsomething else that you have found out.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There isn't time,\\\" J.W. objected. \\\"But if you won't think me a\\nnuisance, maybe I can tell you part of it. For example, Sunday school.\\nLong ago I discovered that the whole church was providing for Sunday\\nschool progress through a Board of Sunday Schools, and there isn't a\\nmodern Sunday school idea anywhere that this Board doesn't put into its\\nscheme of work. I was a very small part of it myself for a while, so I\\nknow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and even I know a little about the Sunday School Board,\\\" confessed\\nMiss Morel. \\\"It has helped us a lot in the Philippines. And so I must\\nadmit that the church does try to improve and extend Sunday school work.\\nWhat else?\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. told about his experiences on the Mexican border, where home\\nmissions and foreign missions came together. Then, seeing that she was\\nreally listening, he told of his and Marty's college days, how Marty had\\nborrowed money from the Board of Education, and how the same Board had a\\nhand in the college evangelistic work. He told about the deaconesses who\\nmanaged the hospital at Manchester, and the training school which Marcia\\nDayne Carbrook had attended when she was getting ready to go to China.\\nThat school had sent out hundreds of deaconesses and other workers.\\n\\nThe thought of Marcia made him think of Joe, and he told what he knew of\\nhow the Wesley Foundation at the State University had helped Joe when he\\ncould easily have made shipwreck of his missionary purpose. Of course\\nthe story of his visit to the Carbrooks in China must also be told.\\n\\nMiss Morel changed the subject again. \\\"Tell me, Mr. Farwell,\\\" she asked,\\n\\\"were you in the Epworth League when you were at home?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I surely was,\\\" said J.W. \\\"That was where I got my first start; at the\\nCartwright Institute.\\\" And the story jumped back to those far-off days\\nwhen he was just out of high school.\\n\\nAs he paused Miss Morel said, \\\"I was an Epworthian, too, and in the\\nyoung women's missionary societies. We had a combination society in our\\nchurch, so I was a 'Queen Esther' and a 'Standard Bearer' as well. Those\\norganizations did me a world of good. You know, when I think of it, the\\nwomen's missionary societies have done a wonderful work in America and\\neverywhere.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I guess they have,\\\" said J.W. \\\"I know my mother has always been a\\nmember of both, and she's always been the most intelligent and active\\nmissionary in the Farwell family.\\\"\\n\\nThe talk languished for a while, and then Miss Morel exclaimed, \\\"I know\\nwhy we've stopped talking; we're hungry. It is almost time for luncheon,\\nand if you have an appetite like mine, you're impatient for the call.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W. looked at his watch and saw that there was only ten minutes of the\\nmorning left. So they separated to get ready against the sounding of the\\ndinner gong.\\n\\nBut J.W. was not hungry. He was struggling with an old thought that to\\nhim had all the tantalizing quality of novelty. The talk of the morning\\nhad become a sort of roll-call of church boards. How did it happen that\\nthe church was busy with this and that and the other work? Why a Board\\nof Hospitals and Homes? Why a Deaconess Board, even though deaconess\\nwork happened to be merciful and gentle and Christlike? What was the\\nchurch doing with a Book Concern? How came it that we had that board\\nwith the long name--Temperance, Prohibition, and Public Morals? He had\\ntraveled from Yokohama to Lucknow and back, and everywhere he had found\\nthis same church doing all sorts of work, with no slightest suspicion\\nbut that all of it was her proper business.\\n\\nSo picture after picture flickered before his mind's eye, as though his\\nbrain had built up a five-reel mental movie from all sorts of memory\\nfilm; a hundred feet of this, two hundred of that, a thousand here,\\nthere just a flash. It had all one common mark; it was all \\\"the church,\\\"\\nbut the hit-and-miss of it, its lightning change, bewildered him. The\\npictures leaped from Cartwright to Cawnpore, from the country church at\\nEllis to Joe Carbrook's hospital in China; from New York and\\nPhiladelphia and Chicago and Cincinnati and Washington to the ends of\\nthe country and the ends of the earth; and in and through it all, swift\\nbits of unrelated yet vivid hints of _Advocates_ and _Heralds_, of\\nprayer meetings and institutes, of new churches and old colleges, of\\nrevivals and sewing societies, of League socials and Annual Conferences,\\nof deaconesses visiting dreary homes, and soft-footed nurses going about\\nin great hospitals; of beginners' departments and old people's homes; of\\nkindergartens and clinics and preparatory classes. There seemed no end\\nto it all, every moment some new aspect of the church's activity showed\\nitself and then was gone.\\n\\nIt was a most confused and confusing experience; and all through the\\nrest of the day J.W. caught himself wondering again and again at the\\nvariety and complexity of the church's affairs.\\n\\nWhy should a church be occupied with all this medley? Why should it be\\nso distracted from its main purpose, to be a Jack of all trades? Why\\nshould it open its doors and train its workers and spend its money in\\npersistent response to every imaginable human appeal?\\n\\nPerhaps that might be it; \\\"_human_.\\\" Once a philosopher had said, \\\"I am\\na man, and therefore nothing human is foreign to me.\\\" What if the church\\nby its very nature must be like that? what if this really were its main\\npurpose--all these varied and sometimes almost conflicting activities no\\nmore than its effort to obey the central law of its life?\\n\\nJ.W. was in his stateroom; he paced the narrow aisle between the\\nberths--three steps forward, three steps back, like a caged wild thing.\\nSomething was coming to new reality in his soul; he was scarce conscious\\nof the walls that shut him in. Once he stopped by the open port. He\\nlooked out at the tumbling rollers of the wide Pacific. And as he looked\\nhe thought of the vastness of this sea, how its waters washed the icy\\nshores of Alaska and the palm-fronded atolls of the Marquesas; how they\\ncarried on their bosom the multitudinous commerce of a hundred peoples;\\nhow from Santiago to Shanghai and from the Yukon to New Zealand it was\\none ocean, serving all lands, and taking toll of all.\\n\\nIn spite of all the complexities and diversities of the lands about this\\nocean, they had one possession which all might claim, as it claimed\\nthem--the sea. It gave them neighbors and trade, climate and their daily\\nbread. In the sociology and geography and economics of the Orient this\\nPacific Ocean was the great common denominator. _And in the geography\\nand economics and sociology of the kingdom of God? Might it not be--must\\nit not be, the church_!\\n\\nNot only the Pacific basin, but the round world was like that, every\\npart of it dependent on all the rest, and growing every day more and\\nmore conscious of all the rest. Railways helped this process, and so did\\nsteamships and air routes and telegraph and wireless. More than that,\\nall the world was becoming increasingly related to the life of every\\npart. With raw material produced in Brazil to make tires for the\\nlimousines of Fifth Avenue and the Lake Shore Drive, what of the new\\nkinship between the producers in Brazil and the users in the States? All\\ngood was coming to be the good of all the earth; and all evil was able\\nto affect the lives of unsuspecting folk half the earth's circumference\\naway.\\n\\nIn such a time, what an insistent call for the program and power of the\\nChristian faith! And the call could be answered. J.W. had seen the\\nchurch applying the program as well in a Chinese city and in an Indian\\nvillage as in his home town and on the Mexican border. He was sure that\\nthe power that was in the Christian message could heal all the hurts of\\nthe world, and bring all peoples into \\\"a world-commonwealth of good\\nwill.\\\"\\n\\nThis was what Jesus meant to do; not just to save here and there a\\nlittle group for heaven out of the general hopelessness, but to save and\\nmake whole the heart of mankind. The church was not, first of all,\\nseeking its own enlargement, but extending the reach of its Founder's\\npurpose. It did all its many-sided work for a far greater reason than\\nany increase in its own numbers and importance; in a word, for the\\nChristianizing of life, Sunday and every day, in Delafield as well as in\\nthe forests of the Amazon and the huddled cities of China.\\n\\nJ.W. sat on the edge of his berth. In the first glow of this new\\nunderstanding his nerves had steadied to a serenity that was akin to\\nawe. Yet he knew he had made no great discovery. The thing he saw had\\nbeen there all the time.\\n\\nThen his mind set to work again on that motley procession of pictures\\nwhich he had likened to a patchwork film. Was it as disjointed as it\\nseemed? Could it not be so put together as to make a true continuity,\\nconsistent and complete?\\n\\nWhy not? In the events of his own life, strangely enough, he had the\\nclue to its right arrangement. By what seemed to be accidental or\\nincidental opportunity it had been his singular fortune to come in\\ncontact with some aspect or another of all the work his church was\\ndoing. And every element of it, from the beginners' class at Delafield\\nto the language school at Nanking, from the college social in First\\nChurch to the celebration at Foochow--it was all New Testament work. Its\\ncenter was always Jesus Christ's teaching or example, or appeal. There\\nwas in its complexity a vast simplicity; each was a part of all, and all\\nwas in each.\\n\\n\\\"John Wesley Farwell, Jr.,\\\" said that young man to himself, \\\"this thing\\nis not your discovery--but how does that bit of Keats' go?\\\"\\n\\n'Then felt I like some watcher of the skies\\n When a new planet swims into his ken;\\nOr like stout Cortez, when with eagle eyes\\n He stared at the Pacific--and all his men\\nLooked at each other with a wild surmise--\\n Silent, upon a peak in Darien,'\\n\\nThere you have it! But I might have known. Cortez, if it _was_ Cortez,\\ncould not have guessed the Pacific. He had nothing to suggest it. But I\\nmight have guessed the singleness of the church's work. What is my name\\nfor, unless I can appreciate the man who said 'The world is my parish,'\\nand who would do anything--sell books, keep a savings bank, open a\\ndispensary--for the sake of saving souls? That's the single idea, the\\nsimple idea. It makes all these queer activities part of one great\\nactivity; and rests them all on one under-girding truth--'The Church's\\none foundation is Jesus Christ her Lord.'\\n\\nBut the wonderful thing to me is that, after all this time, I should\\nsuddenly have found this out for myself!\\n\\n\\\"What a story to take home to Delafield! Pastor Drury is going to have\\nthe surprise of his life!\\\"\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\nThree people met J.W. as his train pulled in to the station at\\nDelafield. The other two were his father and mother.\\n\\nAfter the first tearfully happy greetings, J.W. looked around the\\nplatform. \\\"I rather thought Brother Drury might have come too,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe others exchanged meaning glances, and his father asked, \\\"Then you\\ndidn't get my second letter at San Francisco?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said J.W., in vague alarm, \\\"only the one. What's wrong? Is Mr.\\nDrury--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He's at home now, son,\\\" said the elder Farwell, gravely. \\\"He came home\\nfrom our Conference hospital at Hillcrest two weeks ago. We hope he's\\ngoing to gain considerable strength, but he's had some sort of a\\nstroke, we don't rightly know what, and he's pretty hard hit. He's\\nbetter than he was last week, but he can't leave his room; sits in his\\neasy chair and doesn't say much.\\\"\\n\\nJ.W.'s heart ached. Without always realizing it, he had been counting\\non long talks with the pastor; there was so much to tell him. And\\nespecially so since that wonderful day out in the middle of the Pacific,\\nwhen he had seen what he even dared to call his 'vision' of the church.\\n\\nSo he said, \\\"You and mother drive on home; I'll walk up with Jeannette.\\\"\\n\\nFor lovers who had just met after a year's separation these two were\\nstrangely subdued. They had everything to say to each other, but this\\nsudden falling of the shadow of suffering on their meeting checked the\\nwords on their lips.\\n\\n\\\"Will he get better?\\\" J.W. asked Jeannette.\\n\\n\\\"They fear not,\\\" she answered. \\\"The doctors say he may live for several\\nyears, but he will never preach again. He just sits there; he's been so\\nanxious to see you. You must go to-day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course. And what shall I say about the wedding? If he can't leave\\nhis room----\\\"\\n\\nJeannette interrupted him: \\\"If he can't leave his room, it will make no\\ndifference. Church wedding or home wedding I should have chosen, as I\\nhave told you; but you and I, John Wesley, are going to be married by\\nWalter Drury, wherever he is, if he's alive on our wedding day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, yes,\\\" said J.W., with a little break in his voice, \\\"it wouldn't\\nseem right any other way. We can have the dinner, or breakfast or\\nwhatever it is, just the same, but we'll be married in his room. I'm\\nglad you feel that way about it too; though it's just like you.\\\"\\n\\nAnd it was so. J.W. went up to the study as soon as he could rid himself\\nof the dust of the day's travel, more eager to show Walter Drury he\\nloved him than to tell his story or even to arrange for the wedding.\\n\\nAs to that ceremony, the plans had long ago been understood; nothing\\nmore was needed than to tell Walter Drury his study afforded a better\\nbackground and setting for this particular wedding than a cathedral\\ncould provide.\\n\\nJ.W. was prepared for a great change in Pastor Drury, but he noticed no\\nsuch signs of breakdown as he had expected to see. He did not know that\\nthe beloved pastor was keyed up for this meeting. He could not guess\\nthat the beaming eye, the old radiant smile, the touch of color in a\\nface usually pale, were on special if unconscious display because the\\npastor's heart was thanking God that he had been permitted to welcome\\nhome his son in the gospel.\\n\\nThose had been dreary days, in the hospital, despite the ceaseless\\nministries of nurses and doctors and friends from Delafield. This\\nhospital was a place of noble service, one of many such places which\\nhave arisen in the Methodism of the last forty years. It was a hospital\\nthrough and through--the last word in equipment and competence, but not\\nat all an \\\"institution.\\\" It was at once a home for the sick and a\\ntraining school of the Christian graces, where the distressed of body\\nand mind could be given the relief they needed--all of it given gladly,\\nin Christ's name.\\n\\nWalter Drury was not unmindful of the care and skill which the hospital\\nstaff lavished on him, though no more faithfully on him than on many an\\nunknown or unresponsive patient. But he was in a pitifully questioning\\nmood. The doctors had told him he could not expect to preach again. When\\nthe district superintendent had come to visit him, he carried away with\\nhim Walter Drury's request for retirement at the coming session of the\\nAnnual Conference.\\n\\nIn his quiet moments--there were so many of them now--the broken man\\ncounted up his years of service, all too few, as it seemed to him, and\\nlacking much of what they might have shown in outcomes for the church\\nand the kingdom. His Conference was one of the few which paid the full\\nannuity claim of its retired preachers, but even so he had not much to\\nlook forward to. His twenty-five years in the active ranks meant that he\\ncould count on twenty-five times $15 a year, $375, on which to live,\\nwhen he gave up his work.\\n\\nPerhaps he could live on this, with what little he had been able to put\\naside; at any rate he could be glad now that there was none but himself\\nto think about. But was it worth all he had put into his vocation? His\\nbrother in Saint Louis, not remarkably successful in his business, had\\nbeen able at least to make some provision for his old age. He too might\\nhave been a moderately successful business or professional man. Truly it\\nwas more than the older preachers had, this Conference annuity, which\\nwould keep him from actual want; so much, surely, had been gained by the\\nchurch's growing sense of responsibility for its veterans.\\n\\nBut had it really paid? Was all the gentle efficiency of the hospital,\\nand all the church's money which would come to him from the Conference\\nfunds and the Board of Conference Claimants, enough to compensate him\\nfor the long years when he had been spendthrift of all his powers for\\nthe sake of his work?\\n\\nHe knew, of course, the answer to his questions; no one better. But he\\nwas a broken-down preacher, old before his time; and knowing the answer\\nwas not at all the same as _having_ the answer. So he had been brought\\nhome from Hillcrest, mind-weary and much cast down. Nor did he regain\\nany of his old buoyancy of spirit until the day when they told him J. W,\\nwould be home next week.\\n\\nIt was then that he told himself, \\\"If J.W. has come back with only a\\nstory to tell\\\"--and gloom was in his face; \\\"But if he has come back with\\n_the_ story to tell\\\"--and his heart leaped within him at the thought.\\n\\nThe pastor and J.W. were soon talking away with the old familiarity,\\nbut mostly about inconsequentials. Neither was quite prepared for more\\nintimate communion; and, of course, the returning traveler had much to\\ndo. The wedding was near at hand, and everybody but himself had been\\ngetting ready this long time. So the call was too brief to suit either\\nof them, with the longer visits each hoped for of necessity deferred to\\na more convenient season.\\n\\nJ.W. must make a hurried journey to Saint Louis to turn in his report\\nto Peter McDougall, which report Peter was much better prepared to\\nreceive than J.W. suspected. And a highly satisfactory arrangement was\\nmade for J.W.'s continued connection with the Cummings Hardware\\nCorporation.\\n\\nDoubtless all weddings are much alike in their ceremonial aspects; short\\nor long, solemn-spoken ancient ritual or commonplace legal form, the\\nessence of them all is that this man and this woman say, \\\"I will.\\\" So it\\nwas in Walter Drury's study. And then the little group seated itself\\nabout the pastor; Marty with Alma Wetherell, soon to become Mrs. Marty;\\nall the Shenks, the elder Farwells, John Wesley, Jr., and Jeannette. The\\ndinner would not be for an hour yet, and this was the pastor's time.\\n\\nPastor Drury could not talk much. He had kept his chair as he read the\\nritual, and now he sat and smiled quietly on them all. But once and\\nagain his eye sought J.W. and the look was a question yet unanswered.\\n\\n\\\"What sort of a voyage home did you have?\\\" Mrs. Farwell asked her son,\\nmotherlike, using even a query about the weather to turn attention to\\nher boy.\\n\\n\\\"A good voyage, mother,\\\" said J.W. \\\"A fine voyage. But one day--will\\nyou let me tell it here, all of you? I've hardly been any more eager\\nfor my wedding day than for a chance to say this. I won't tire you, Mr.\\nDrury, will I?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You'll never do that, my boy,\\\" said the preacher. \\\"But don't bother\\nabout me, I've long had a feeling that what you are going to say will be\\nbetter for me than all the doctors.\\\" For he had seen the eager glow on\\nJ.W.'s face, and his heart was ready to be glad.\\n\\nThus it was that J.W. told the story of his great moment; how he had\\ntalked with Miss Morel one morning of the many-sided work of the church,\\nand how in the afternoon he had looked through the open port of his\\nstateroom and had seen an ocean that looked like the church, and a\\nchurch that seemed like the ocean.\\n\\n\\\"I shall remember that day forever, I think,\\\" he said. \\\"For the first\\ntime in my life I could put all the pieces of my life together; my home,\\nmy church, the Sunday school, the League, college, the needy life of\\nthis town, your country work, Marty, Mexico, China, India--everything;\\nand I could see as one wonderful, perfect picture, every bit of it\\nnecessary to all the rest. Our church at work to make Jesus Christ Lord\\nof all life, in my home and clear to the 'roof of the world' out yonder\\nunder the snows of Tibet. Can you see it, folks? I think _you_ always\\ncould, Mr. Drury!\\\" and he put his hand affectionately on the pastor's\\nknee.\\n\\nPastor Drury's face was even paler than its wont, but in his eyes glowed\\nthe light that never was on sea or land. He was hearing what sometimes\\nhe had feared he might not last long enough to hear. The Experiment was\\njustified, and he was comforted!\\n\\nHe picked up the Bible that lay near his hand, and turned to the Gospel\\nby Luke. \\\"I hope none of you will think _I_ wrest the Book's words to\\nlesser meanings,\\\" he said, \\\"but there is only one place in it that can\\nspeak what is in my heart to-day.\\\" And he read the song of Simeon in the\\ntemple: \\\"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine\\neyes have seen thy salvation,\\\" and so to the end.\\n\\nIt was very still when his weak voice ceased; but in a moment the\\nsilence was broken by a cry from J.W.\\n\\n\\\"Why, Mr. Drury, it has been _you_, all these years!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you mean, J.W.?\\\". said Marty, somewhat alarmed and thoroughly\\nmystified.\\n\\n\\\"Exactly what I say, Marty. Can't you see it too? Can't all of you see\\nit?\\\" and J.W. looked from one face to another around the room.\\n\\\"Jeannette, _you_ know what I mean, don't you?\\\"\\n\\nAnd Jeannette, at once smiling and tearful, said, \\\"Yes, J.W., I've\\nthought about it many times, and I know now it is true.\\\"\\n\\nMarty said, \\\"Maybe so; but what?\\\" for he was still bewildered.\\n\\n\\\"Why,\\\" J.W. began, with eager haste, \\\"Mr. Drury planned all this--years\\nand years ago. Not our wedding, I don't mean that,\\\" and he paused long\\nenough to find Jeannette's hand and get it firmly in his own, \\\"we\\nmanaged that ourselves, didn't we, dear? But--I don't know why--this\\nblessed minister of God began, somewhere far back yonder, to show me\\nwhat God was trying to do through our church, and, later, through the\\nother churches. He saw that I went to Institute. He steered me through\\nmy Sunday school work. He showed me my lifework. He made me want to go\\nto college. He introduced me to the Delafield that is outside our own\\nchurch. He got me my job in Saint Louis--don't you dare to deny it,\\\" as\\nthe pastor raised a protesting hand. \\\"I've talked with our sales\\nmanager; he put the idea of the Far Eastern trip into Mr. McDougall's\\nmind--and, well, it has been Pastor Drury all these years, _and he knew\\nwhat he was doing_!\\\"\\n\\nPastor Drury had kept his secret bravely, but there was no need to keep\\nit longer, and now he was well content that these dear friends should\\nhave discovered it on such a day of joy. After all, it had been a\\nbeautiful Experiment, and not altogether without its value. So he made\\nno more ado, and in his heart there was a great peace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JOHN WESLEY, JR ***\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\\u2014the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

H. Heffner]\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Youthful Wanderer;\\n\\nor An Account of a Tour through England, France, Belgium, Holland, Germany\\nand the Rhine, Switzerland, Italy, and Egypt\\n\\nAdapted to the Wants of Young Americans Taking Their First Glimpses at the\\nOld World\\n\\nby\\n\\nGeo. H. Heffner.\\n\\n\\n1876.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPreface.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt had been fashionable among the ancients, for men of learning to visit\\ndistant countries and improve their education by traveling, after they had\\ncompleted their various courses of study in literary institutions, and the\\nsame custom still prevails in Europe at the present time; but in our\\ncountry, comparatively few avail themselves of this finishing course. It\\nis not strange that this should have been so with a people who are\\nseparated from the rest of the world by such wide oceans as we are, which\\ncould, up to a comparatively recent period, only have been crossed at a\\nsacrifice of much time and money, and at the risk of loosing either life\\nor health. These difficulties have been greatly reduced by the application\\nof steam-power to navigation, and the time has come when an American can\\nmake the tour of Europe with but little more expenditure of time and money\\nthan it costs even a native of Europe to do it.\\n\\nOne of my principal objects in writing this book is to encourage others to\\nmake similar tours. We would have plenty of books no traveling, if some of\\nthem did represent the readers in the humbler spheres of life, but the\\ngeneral impression in America is that no one can see Europe to any\\nsatisfaction in less than a year or two and with an outlay of from a\\nthousand to two thousand dollars. This is a great mistake. If one travels\\nfor pleasure mainly, it will certainly require a great deal of time and\\nmoney, but a hard-working student can do much in a few months. Permit me\\nto say, that one will see and experience more in two weeks abroad, than\\nmany a learned man in America expects could be seen in a year. I sometimes\\ngive the particulars of sights and adventures in detail, that the reader\\nmay take an example of my experience, for any tour he may propose to make.\\nThe times devoted to different places are given that he may form an\\nestimate of the comparative importance of different places.\\n\\nStatistics form a leading feature of this work, and these have been\\ngathered and compiled with special reference to the wants of the student.\\nMany an American scholar studies the geography and history of foreign\\ncountries at a great disadvantage, because he can not obtain a general\\nidea of the institutions of Europe, unless he reads half a dozen works on\\nthe subject. To do this he has not the time. This work gives, in the\\ncompass of a single volume, a general idea of all the most striking\\nfeatures of the manners, customs and institutions of the people of some\\neight different nations speaking as many different languages and dialects.\\n\\nAs the sights that one sees abroad are so radically different from what we\\nare accustomed to see at home, I feel pained whenever I think of\\ndescribing them to any one. If you would know the nature of my\\nperplexity, then go to Washington and see the stately magnificence of our\\nNational Capitol there, and then go and describe what you have seen to one\\nwho has never seen a larger building than his village church; or go and\\nsee the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia, and then tell your neighbor\\nwho has never seen anything greater than a county fair, how, what he has\\nseen compares with the World's Fair! I too am proud of our country, (not\\nso much for what she now is, but because she promises to become the\\ngreatest nation that ever existed), but it must be confessed, that America\\npresents little in the sphere of architecture that bears comparison with\\nthe castles, palaces and churches of the Old World. The Capitol at\\nWashington, erected at the cost of twelve and a half millions, the City\\nHall of Baltimore, perhaps more beautiful but less magnificent, and other\\nedifices that have been erected of late, are structures of which we may\\njustly be proud; but let us take the buildings of the \\\"Centennial\\nExposition\\\" for a standard and compare them with some of those in Europe.\\nThe total expenses incurred in erecting all the exposition buildings, and\\npreparing the grounds, &c., with all the contingent expenses, is less than\\nten million. But St. Peter's in Rome cost nine times, and the palace and\\npleasure-garden of Versailles twenty times as much as this! It is safe to\\nassert, that if a young man had but two hundred dollars with six weeks of\\ntime at his command, and would spend it in seeing London and Paris, he\\ncould never feel sorry for it. _Young student go east._\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContents.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter I.\\n\\n Leaving Home\\n New York\\n Brooklyn--Plymouth Church\\n Extracts from Henry Ward Beecher's Sermon\\n Greenwood Cemetery\\n Barnum's Hippodrome\\n On Board the \\\"Manhattan\\\"\\n Setting Sail--The Parting Hour\\n Sea-Sickness\\n A Shoal of Whales\\n Approaching Queenstown--The First Sight of Land\\n Coasting Ireland and Wales\\n Personal Incidents--Life-boat, No. 5\\n\\n\\nChapter II.\\n\\n Liverpool\\n The Mystical Letters \\\"IHS\\\" mean Jesus\\n The Wonderful Clock of Jacob Lovelace\\n\\n\\nChapter III.\\n\\n Chester--Origin of the Name\\n The Rows or Second-Story Pavements\\n The Cathedral and St. John's\\n The Walls\\n Birmingham\\n _Railroads in Europe_\\n\\n\\nChapter IV.\\n\\n Stratford-on-Avon--- Shakespeare's Birthplace\\n Shottery--Anne Hathaway's Home\\n Shakespeare's Grave\\n\\n\\nChapter V.\\n\\n Warwick--St. Mary's\\n Kenilworth Castle\\n Approaching Coventry--\\\"The Lover's Promenade\\\"\\n Coventry--Its Fine Churches\\n Warwick Castle\\n Oxford--The Great University\\n\\n\\nChapter VI.\\n\\n London.\\n\\n Its Underground Railroads\\n Territory, Population and Other Statistics\\n St. Paul's Cathedral\\n Crystal Palace\\n The Houses of Parliament\\n Westminster Abbey\\n _Ensigns Armorial, &c._\\n Sunday in London\\n Hyde Park--Radical Meeting\\n The Tower of London\\n\\n\\nChapter VII.\\n\\n London to Paris.\\n\\n Strait of Dover\\n Calais\\n\\n\\nChapter VIII.\\n\\n Paris.\\n\\n Its Railway Stations,\\n _Lack of Delicacy in Many of the Social Habits and Institutions\\n Among the People of Warm Countries_\\n The Boulevards, Rues, &c.\\n Arcades and Passages\\n Palais Royal\\n Its Diamond Windows\\n The Cafe--A Characteristic Feature of Modern\\n Civilization\\n Champs Elysees\\n Palais de l'Industrie or the Exhibition Buildings\\n Place de la Concorde and the Obelisk of Luxor\\n Garden of the Tuileries\\n The Arch of Triumph\\n Other Triumphal Arches\\n The Tomb of Napoleon I\\n Artesian Wells\\n Notre Dame Cathedral\\n The Pantheon\\n The Madeleine\\n The Louvre\\n Theaters and Operas\\n At a Ball\\n Incidents\\n\\n\\nChapter IX.\\n\\n St. Cloud\\n The Palace at Versailles\\n The Pleasure-Garden\\n\\n\\nChapter X.\\n\\n Leaving Paris\\n Brussels\\n The Cathedral\\n Hotel de Ville\\n Antwerp\\n _The Spirit of Revolution_\\n Notre Dame Cathedral\\n The Museum\\n\\n\\nChapter XI.\\n\\n Holland.\\n\\n The Hague\\n _Cloak-Rooms_\\n Utrecht\\n\\n\\nChapter XII.\\n\\n Cologne\\n The Cathedral\\n The Museum\\n Depths of Man's Degradation\\n Bonn\\n The Kreuzberg\\n The Drachenfels\\n\\n\\nChapter XIII.\\n\\n Coblentz\\n Geological Laws\\n On the Rhine\\n Frankfort\\n Darmstadt\\n Worms\\n\\n\\nChapter XIV.\\n\\n The Palatinate, (_Die Pfalz_).\\n\\n Mannheim\\n Neustadt\\n Heidelberg\\n The Castle\\n The Great Tun\\n Stuttgart\\n Strassburg\\n The Black Forest\\n\\n\\nChapter XV.\\n\\n Switzerland.\\n\\n The Rigi\\n The Giessbach Falls\\n The Rhone Glacier\\n The Grimsel\\n The Cathedral of Freiburg\\n Berne\\n\\n\\nChapter XVI.\\n\\n Geneva to Turin\\n Mont Cenis Tunnel\\n\\n Italy.\\n\\n Its Fair Sky and Beautiful People,\\n Milan\\n Venice\\n San Marco\\n\\n\\nChapter XVII.\\n\\n Venice to Bologne\\n Florence\\n Pisa\\n Going Southward\\n\\n\\nChapter XVIII.\\n\\n Rome.\\n\\n The Colosseum\\n The Roman Forum\\n The Site of the Ancient Capitol\\n \\\"Twelve\\\"\\n The Temple of C\\u00e6sar\\n The Baths of Caracalla\\n The Pyramid of Cestius\\n St. Peter's\\n The Lateran\\n Santa Maria Maggiore\\n Museums\\n\\n\\nChapter XIX.\\n\\n Rome to Brindisi.\\n\\n Ascent of Mount Vesuvius,\\n The Ruins of Pompeii\\n\\n\\nChapter XX.\\n\\n On the Mediterranean\\n Alexandria\\n Cairo\\n Wretchedness of the Poorer Classes\\n The Return Trip\\n Conclusion\\n\\n\\nSubjects treated in a general way are distinguished by being rendered in\\nitalics, in this table of contents.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: The Keystone State Normal School.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter I.\\n\\nLeaving Home.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile engaged in making the preliminary arrangements for leaving soon\\nafter the \\\"Commencement\\\" of the Keystone State Normal School (coming off\\nJune 24th), information was received that the \\\"Manhattan,\\\" an old and\\nwell-tried steamer of the Guion Line, would sail from New York for\\nLiverpool on the 22nd of June. She had been upon the ocean for nine years,\\nand had acquired the reputation of being \\\"_safe but slow_.\\\" As I esteemed\\n_life_ more precious than _time_, though either of them once lost can\\nnever be recovered, I soon decided to share my fate with her--by her, to\\nbe carried safely to the \\\"farther shore,\\\" or with her, to seek a watery\\ngrave.\\n\\nThe idea of remaining for the Commencement, was at once abandoned; short\\nvisits, abrupt farewells, and a hasty preparation for the pilgrimage, were\\nmy portion for the few days still left me, and Saturday, the 19th, was\\ndetermined upon as the day for leaving home. It would be evidence of gross\\ningratitude to forget the kind wishes, tender good-byes, and many other\\nmarks of attention, on the part of friends and acquaintances, which\\ncharacterized the parting hour. Both Literary Societies had passed\\nresolutions to turn out, and on the ringing of the bell at 6:30 a.m., all\\nassembled in the Chapel, and addresses were delivered.\\n\\nHalf an hour later, we left in procession for the depot, where we arrived\\nin time to exchange our last tokens of remembrance--cards, books, bouquets\\n&c., and shake hands once more.\\n\\nWhile the train was moving away, the benedictions and cheers of a hundred\\nfamiliar voices rang upon the air, and waving handkerchiefs caught the\\nechoes even from the distant cupola of the now fast receding Normal School\\nbuildings. A number of torpedoes that had been placed under the wheels of\\nthe locomotive, had already apprised us that the train was in motion, and\\nwould soon hurry us out of sight. During all this excitement of the\\nparting hour, which seemed to affect some so deeply, I was either looking\\ninto the future, or contemplating the present, rather, from an _active_\\nthan from a _passive_ standpoint; and, as a natural consequence, remained\\nquite tranquil and composed--my feelings and emotions being at a lower ebb\\nthan they could now be, if the occasion would repeat itself. The idea of\\nmaking a tour through Europe and to the Orient, had been continually\\nrevolving in my mind for many years; and now, that I saw the prospect open\\nof once realizing the happy dreams of my childhood, and the schemes of\\nearly youth, I took no time for contemplating the dangers of sea voyages\\nor any of the other perils of adventure.\\n\\nBefore we came to Easton, I formed the acquaintance of a Swiss mother,\\nwho seemed much pleased to find one that was about to visit her dear\\n\\\"Fatherland,\\\" where she had spent the sunny days of her childhood. After\\ngiving me directions and letters of introduction, she entreated me very\\nearnestly to visit her home and kin, and bring them word from her.\\n\\nNew York was reached at 12:10 p.m. As there were but three days remaining\\nfor seeing the city, I immediately began my visits to some of its\\nprincipal points of interest. Having first engaged a room at a hotel in\\nthe vicinity of the new Post-Office, I commenced to stroll about, and at\\n5:30 p.m., entered Trinity Church. Its capacious interior soon disclosed\\nto me numerous architectural peculiarities, such as are characteristic of\\nthe English parish churches or of cathedrals in general; and which render\\nold Trinity quite conspicuous among her American sisters. A fee of twelve\\ncents entitled me to an ascent of its lofty spire, which can be made to\\nthe height of 304 (?) steps, or about 225 feet.\\n\\nSunday, June 20th. Rose at 4:30 a.m. and visited Central Park. This being\\nan importune time for seeing the gay and fashionable life of the city, I\\ncontended myself with a walk to the Managerie, and returned in time to\\nattend the forenoon service of Plymouth Church, in Brooklyn. I reached the\\nplace before 9:00 o'clock, and formed the acquaintance of a young\\ngentleman who was a great admirer of the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, and,\\nbeing an occasional visitor at this church, knew how to get a seat in that\\ncongregation, which generally closed its doors against the faces of\\nhundreds, after every available seat was occupied. We at once took our\\nstand at the middle gate, and there endured the pressure of the crowd for\\nmore than half an hour before the doors opened. We were the first two that\\nentered, and running up stairs at the head of the dashing throng,\\nsucceeded in making sure of a place in the audience. The church has\\nseating capacity for about 2,800 adults. All the pews are rented to\\nmembers of the congregation by the year, except the outer row of seats\\nalong the three walls; but these are generally all occupied in one or\\nseveral minutes after the doors open.\\n\\nThe choir files in at 10:25. A \\\"voluntary\\\" by the organist at 10:30, and\\nby the choir at 10:32, during which time Mr. Beecher comes in, jerks his\\nhat behind a boquet stand, and takes his seat. Leads in a prayer in so low\\na strain that he can not be understood at any remote place in the\\naudience. At 10:55 he baptizes eight infants, whose names are passed to\\nhim on cards. Concludes another prayer at 11:20 and announces his text,\\n\\\"Christ and him crucified.\\\" I Cor. ii. 2\\n\\n\\n\\nExtracts from the Sermon.\\n\\n\\n\\\"One of Christ's followers once said, 'If all that Christ said and did\\nwere written in books, the world could not contain them. This is an\\n_exageration_, (_a ripple of laughter dances over the congregation_),\\nhaving a great meaning, however.\\\" * * * * \\\"David gives us only his\\n_intense_ life.\\\" (_The audience smile_). (11:35). The preacher becoming\\ndramatic in gesticulation and oratorical in delivery, walks back and forth\\nupon the elevated platform. While describing the crosses which he saw\\nyesterday, he becomes highly excited, swinging his arms above his head.\\n\\\"Crosses everywhere. All the way up street; on every beauty's breast.\\\"\\n(_Explosive laughter_). \\\"Some may have cost $500, others possibly $1,500;\\nperhaps some cost $2,000.\\\" (_Claps his hands in excitement_). \\\"Some say\\n'the church handed down Christianity'; but I say Christianity kept the\\nchurch alive. What was it, that, in the Reformation, made blood such a\\nsweet manure for souls?\\\" (12:10 p.m.) Pleads earnestly for the weak and\\nthe erring. \\\"A man that has gone wrong, and has nobody to be sorry for it\\nis lost; pity may save.\\\" Sermon concluded at 12:25. Prayer. Dismissal by\\nsinging.\\n\\nMr. Beecher's voice is so clear and powerful, that he can be readily\\nunderstood in the most distant parts of the house. After leaving church, I\\nwent up to Columbia Heights, the most aristocratic section of Brooklyn,\\nwhere I enjoyed myself in contemplating the beautiful and magnificent\\nbuildings which constitute the quiet and charming homes of those wealthy\\npeople living there. How partial Heaven is to some of her children! Thence\\nI found my way to Greenwood Cemetery, where I spent the remainder of the\\nday amid the tombs and monuments of \\\"the great city of the dead.\\\" Guide\\nbooks containing all the carriage roads and foot-paths of that burial\\nground, are sold at or near the gate. One of these I procured, and found\\nit was so perfect in the particulars, that I could readily find the grave\\nof any one of the many distinguished persons mentioned in the index,\\nwithout further assistance whatever. It is impossible here to give an\\naccount of the many splendid tombs and monuments erected there by loving\\nhearts and skillful hands, in memory of dear friends and relatives that\\nhave \\\"gone away!\\\" What multitudes of strange and curious designs meet the\\neye here! Some few perhaps seem odd; but most of them bear appropriate\\nemblems, and convey sweet thoughts and tender sentiments in behalf of\\nthose \\\"sleeping beneath the sod.\\\" What a place for meditation! How quiet,\\nhow solemn! No one should visit New York without allotting at least half a\\nday to these holy grounds. How I wander from grave to grave! Here I am\\nstruck with the text of an impressive epitaph, and there I see the\\ndelicate and elaborate workmanship of a skillful master. Here my heart is\\ntouched by the sweet simplicity of a simple slab bearing some touching\\nlines, there I stand in silent admiration before the magnificent\\nproportions of a towering monument, or sit down to study the meaning of\\nsome obscure design. A mere sketch of all that I saw there would fill a\\nvolume, but I found one monument which I cannot pass by without some\\nnotice. It stands on Hilly Ridge, and was erected to the memory of six\\n\\\"_lost at sea_, on board the steamer 'Arctic,' Sept. 27th, 1854.\\\" These\\nwords arrested my attention, and a minute later, I had ascended the\\ndomical summit of the hill, and stood at the foot of the high monument. It\\nhas a square granite base upon which stand four little red pillars of\\npolished Russian granite, supporting a transversely arched canopy, with a\\nhigh spire. Under the canopy is represented the Ocean and the shipwreck of\\nthe \\\"Arctic.\\\" The vessel is assailed by a terrible storm, and fiercely\\ntossed upon the foaming waves! She has already sprung a leak, and through\\nthe ugly gash admits a copious stream of the fatal liquid, while the\\nraging sea, like an angry monster, is about to swallow her distined prey!\\nDown she goes, and among the many passengers on board, are\\n\\n Grace, _wife of Geo. F. Allen and daughter of James Brown, born Aug.\\n 25th, 1821._\\n\\n Herbert, _infant child of Geo.

As the ship wreck occurred in the fall, it is highly\\nprobable that the party was homeward bound and, had better fortune been\\nwith them, might in a very few days have again been safe and happy in\\ntheir respective homes, relating stories of their strange but pleasant\\nexperiences in the Old World. How changed the tale! How their friends must\\nhave been looking and waiting for the \\\"Arctic!\\\" One line told the whole\\nstory, and perhaps all that was ever heard of them, \\\"The 'Arctic' is\\nwrecked!\\\"\\n\\nNot far away, on the crown of Locust Hill, sleeps Horace Greeley,\\nAmerica's great journalist and political economist. At the head of his\\ngrave stands a temporal memorial stone in the form of a simple marble\\nslab, bearing the inscription, \\\"Horace Greeley, born February 3rd, 1811;\\ndied November 29th, 1872.\\\" I left the Cemetery at 7:45 p.m., and returned\\nto my quarters in New York.\\n\\nMonday, June 21st. Having procured passage with the \\\"Manhattan,\\\" which was\\nto sail on the morrow, I straightway went to Pier No. 46, North River, _to\\ntake a look at her_! At 12:45 p.m. I stood in the third story of A.T.\\nStewart's great dry goods establishment, perhaps the largest of kind in\\nthe world. It is six stories high, and covers nearly two acres of ground.\\nMy next point of destination was Brooklyn Court-House. The afternoon\\nsession opened at 2:00 o'clock, but I did not reach the place until half\\nan hour later. The court-room was crowded as usual, and many had been\\nturned away, who stood in knots about the halls and portico, holding the\\nposts, and discussing politics and church matters. I entered hastily, like\\none behind time and in a hurry, and inquired where the court-room was. \\\"It\\nis crowded to over-flowing, you can not enter,\\\" was the reply; but I went\\nfor the reporter's door. A few raps, and it was opened. I offered my card\\nand asked for a place in the audience as a reporter. The reply was that\\nthe room was already jammed full. But I retained my position in the door\\nall the same! \\\"What paper do you represent?\\\" asked the door-keeper. \\\"I am\\na correspondent of the _National Educator\\\"_ was my response; whereupon he\\nbid me step in. The court-room was a small one for the occasion, affording\\nseats for about 400 on the floor, and for 125 more in the gallery. Some\\ntwenty-five or thirty ladies were scattered through the audience. Mr.\\nBeech, Tilton's senior lawyer, was summing up his closing speech. Tilton\\nand Fullerton sat immediately behind him, but Mr. Beecher was not in\\ncourt. Toward the close of the session there was a kind of \\\"clash of arms\\\"\\namong the opposing lawyers. Fullerton repeated the challenge previously\\nmade by Beech, offering to prove that corrupt influences were made to bear\\nupon the jury. The Judge appointed a time for hearing the complaint, and\\nadjourned the Court.\\n\\n\\n\\nBarnum's Hippodrome\\n\\n\\nwas visited in the evening, where I saw for the first time on a grand\\nscale, the charming features of the European _\\\"cafe_\\\" (pronounced\\nc\\u00e4'f[=a]'). Here are combined the attractions of the pleasure garden or\\npublic square, with the ornaments and graces of the ball-room and the\\nopera. It is a magnificent parlor abounding in trees, fountains, statuary\\nand rustic retreats. Gilmore's large band of seventy-five to a hundred\\npieces, occupying an elevated platform in the centre, render excellent\\nmusic. Fifteen hundred to two thousand gas jets, eveloped by globes of\\ndifferent colors (red, white, blue, yellow and green) and blazing from the\\ncurves of immense arches, spanning the Hippodrome in different directions,\\nilluminate the entire building with the brilliancy of the noon-day sun. To\\nthe right of the entrance is an artificial water-fall about thirty feet\\nin height. Two stationary engines supply the water, elevating 1,800\\ngallons per minute, which issues from beneath the arched roof of a\\nsubterranean cavern, and dashing down in broken sheets over a series of\\ncascades and rapids, plunges into a basin below. From this basin it flows\\naway into tanks in an other building, where four to five tons of ice are\\nconsumed daily to keep it at a low temperature, so that the vapor and\\nbreeze produced by this ice-water, at the foot of the cataract, refreshes\\nthe air and keeps it cool and pleasant during the warm summer evenings.\\nThe admittance is fifty cents, and 5,000 to 10,000 persons enter every\\nnight, during the height of the season. Here meets \\\"youth and beauty,\\\" and\\nthe wealth, gayety and fashion of New York is well represented,\\n\\nTuesday, June 22d. I spent the morning in writing farewell letters, and\\nmaking the final preparations for leaving. At one o'clock I went on board\\nthe \\\"Manhattan,\\\" which was still quite empty. In order to have something\\nto do by which to while away the slow dull hours yet remaining, I\\ncommenced writing a letter. None of my friends or acquaintances being with\\nme, I bid all my farewells by note. But such writing! Though the vessel\\nwas locked to the pier by immense cables, still she was anything but\\nsteady. As passengers began to multiply, acquaintances were formed. By and\\nby the stewart came around, and assigned to us our berths. Ship government\\nis monarchic in form. The officers have almost absolute authority, and\\nthe passengers, like bashful pupils, do their best to learn the new rules\\nand regulations and adapt their conduct to them, as soon as possible, so\\nthat nobody may find occasion for making observations or passing remarks.\\nAll these things remind one very much of a first day at school. As\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Parting Hour\\n\\n\\napproaches, large numbers of the friends and relatives of some of our\\npassengers, came upon deck to bid good-by. Some cried, others laughed, and\\nmany more _tried_ to laugh. Some that seemed to relish repetition, or were\\ncarried away by enthusiasm and the excitement of the hour, shook hands\\nover, and over again with the same person. At 3:00 o'clock p.m., the\\ngangway was lowered and the cables were removed. A shock, a boom, and the\\nvessel swung away and glided into the river! The die was cast, and our\\nfate was sealed. Shouts and huzzas rent the air, as the steamer skimmed\\nproudly over the waves, while clouds of handkerchiefs, on deck and upon\\nthe receding shore, waved in the air as long as we could see each other.\\nDown, down the river glided the steady \\\"Manhattan,\\\" and our thoughts began\\nto run in new channels. \\\"Good-by! dear, sweet America,\\\" thought we a\\nhundred times, while we watched the retreating shores; perhaps our\\nthoughts were whispers! Europe with its innumerable attractions, its Alps,\\nAppennines and Vesuvius, its castles, palaces, walled towns, fine cities,\\ngreat battle fields, ancient ruins and a thousand other milestones of\\ncivilization, lay before us; but a wide Ocean, and all the dangers and\\nperils of a long sea voyage lay between us and that other--longed for\\nshore.\\n\\nThe question whether we would ever realize the pleasure of a visit to the\\nOld World, was now reduced to the alternatives of _success_, or _failure\\nby accident or disease_.\\n\\n\\n\\nSea-Sickness.\\n\\n\\nI had labored under the erroneous impression that sea-sickness was bred of\\nfear and terror, and would attack only women (of both sexes) and children\\nof tender minds and frail constitutions. But, when the waves commenced to\\nroll higher, and the ship began a ceaseless rocking, which was in direct\\nopposition to the wants and comfort of my system, as all manner of\\nswinging ever was, I began to have fears that it was not _fright_, but\\n_swinging_, that made people sick at sea. The inner man threatened to\\nrebel, and I made my calculations how much higher the billows might swell,\\nbefore stomachs would be apt to revolt. We sailed out of sight of the land\\nbefore dusk, by which time, however, numbers of ill-mannered stomachs had\\ngiven evidence of their bad humor. Though I nodded but once or twice to\\nold Neptune, during the entire voyage, still I suffered much during the\\nfirst five days, from the pressure of intense dizziness and headache,\\noccasioned by the incessant rocking of our vessel upon the restless\\nwaves. We had a very fine passage, as the sailors would say, but it was\\nfar from being as fine as I had always fancied fine sea voyages would be.\\nThe rocking of the ship would never be less than about two feet up and\\ndown in its width of thirty feet. When the winds blew hard and the waves\\nrolled high, it swung some, twenty or twenty-five feet up and down at its\\nbow and at the stern. The highest waves that we saw in our outward passage\\nwere probably from twelve to eighteen feet. That the rocking or swinging\\nof the ship, is the one and only cause of sea-sickness, may admit of a\\nquestion; but that it is the principal cause, there can be little doubt.\\nMy observations and experiences in five or six voyages (long and short)\\ndid not point to any other cause. As the sea air is generally regarded as\\nmore salubrious and healthier than that on land, it can certainly not be a\\ncause of sea-sickness. Fright and terror, in a timid person might perhaps\\naggravate the disease in few instances, though it seems doubtful, to say\\nthe least. When the sea is calm and smooth, everybody feels well, even if\\nthe vessel swims in the middle of the Ocean; but let a storm come on, and\\nthe number of sick will increase in proportion to its violence.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhales.\\n\\n\\nOn the second day of our voyage, in the afternoon at about 4:00 o'clock,\\nwe came across a shoal of whales. There must have been two or three dozen\\nof them. They apparently avoided our ship, as only a few made their\\nappearance very close by, though we sailed through the midst of them. They\\nswam about leisurely near the surface, betraying their whereabouts\\nfrequently by spouting; but occasionally they would rise considerably\\nabove the surface of the water, and expose large portions of their bodies\\nto our view. The excitement occasioned among all on board, by the\\nappearance of so many of these terrible monsters, greatly quickened our\\ndull spirits, and tended much to alleviate the lonesomeness occasioned by\\nthe monotony of the sea voyage.\\n\\nNo one who has never experienced it, can form an idea of how the mind is\\ndepressed and benumbed by the monotony of sea life. The nights drag along\\nso slowly, and the days--they seem to have no end. One will often loose\\nhis \\\"bearings\\\" so completely, that he knows neither what day of the week\\nit is, nor whether it is forenoon or afternoon. Without keeping a diary or\\nrecord of some kind, it would be difficult for many to keep a sure run of\\nthe date. Ordinarily, one sits down early in the morning _to wait for the\\nevening to draw by_, and often it happens, when it seems to him that he\\nhas waited the length of three days on the land, he is mortified by the\\nannouncement that it is yet far from being noon! An eternal present seems\\nto swallow up both the past and the future. After a week or two of such\\nweary waiting, one feels as if he had forgotten almost every thing that\\nhappened before the day of his leaving home. I remarked one day to a\\ncompany of passengers on deck, that I could scarcely recall any thing that\\nhad happened in the past; indeed, it required quite an effort to remember\\nthat I had ever been in America, or anywhere else except on the old\\n\\\"Manhattan\\\" in an everlasting voyage. \\\"Yes,\\\" observed one of the company,\\n\\\"and I heard a fellow say yesterday that time seemed so long to him, that\\nhe had really forgotten how many children he had.\\\" There is little doubt,\\nthat if a ship-load of passengers could be suddenly and unexpectedly\\nlanded upon the grassy slope of a verdant hillside; many would under\\nmomentary impulse of overwhelming pleasure, kiss the dear earth, as\\nColumbus did on landing at San Salvador, if, indeed, extreme joy did not\\nimpel them to make themselves ridiculous by imitating old Nebuchadnezzar,\\nin commencing to graze on the herbage! But the longest day must have an\\nend, and so have sea voyages.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe First Sight of Land.\\n\\n\\nOn Saturday morning, July 3rd, everybody came upon deck in hope of seeing\\nland. A report was soon circulated, that the sailors with their\\ntelescopes, had already seen the mountains of Ireland. Those passengers\\nthat had telescopes or opera glasses soon brought them upon deck. Some\\nsaid they saw the land, but others using the same glasees could see\\nnothing. This, created a pleasant excitement with but little\\nsatisfaction, however, except a lively hope of soon seeing _terra firma_\\nagain. At about 8:00 o'clock (4:00 o'clock Penna. time) it was believed by\\nthe passengers generally, that land was really in sight. When I first saw\\nthe outline of the mountains through the mist and clouds that hung near\\nthe horizon, it stood out so clear and bold that I felt surprised at not\\nhaving been able to see it long before, as some others had. There were\\nsome who could not see the land till an hour afterwards. The inexperienced\\nmust first _learn_, before they will know _how_ to see land. The first\\nlight-house (one sixty miles from Queenstown) came into view at 9:35 a.m.\\nWe passed it at 10:00 o'clock.\\n\\nWhite sea-gulls come one or two days' journey into the sea to meet the\\nships, and follow them for food. These had been increasing from an early\\nhour, and amounted to about fifty in number in the afternoon. It seems as\\nif their wings would never tire. All-day long they fly after the ships,\\nsometimes even coming over the deck near the passengers.\\n\\nA great excitement prevailed on board during the whole day, because a\\nnumber of our passengers were to leave us there. While these were getting\\nready to depart, and bidding good-by to their many friends on board, many\\nof us were busy writing letters to our friends and relatives in America.\\nThose letters were taken on to Queenstown, there mailed, and brought the\\nfirst news of our safe passage across the Atlantic. We were still a day\\nfrom Liverpool, but it was a day of pleasure. The dangers of the deep were\\nnow forgotten, the strong winds of the Ocean had abated, and health and\\nhappiness over all on board prevailed. Our course continued along.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Coasts of Ireland and Wales.\\n\\n\\nAt about 4:00 o'clock p.m., the little steamer \\\"Lord Lyons\\\" came up to our\\nship to fetch the passengers that were bound for Queenstown. A company of\\nfruit-women came on board with gooseberries, raspberries and many other\\ngood things with which they fed our famished passengers. These were our\\nfirst fruits of the season, and were highly relished by all.\\n\\nThe vegetation of Ireland is remarkable for its fresh, green color. We all\\nagreed that we had never seen such a rich green color before. \\\"Emerald\\nIsle\\\" (the _green island_) is a very appropriate name for Ireland, We saw\\nmany light-houses and beautiful castles hanging upon the rocky shores or\\nstanding proudly upon commanding eminences. Steamers keep so close to the\\nshore in sailing from Queenstown to Liverpool, that the land is nearly\\nalways in sight. On Sunday morning, July 4th, the charming fields of\\nIreland had been exchanged for the lofty mountains of Wales. We passed\\nHolyhead at 9:00 o'clock, and Liverpool came into sight at 1:30 p.m. An\\nhour later we came so near to the coast that the individual trees of a\\nshady wood upon the shores could readily he discerned. By 3:25 we had\\nentered the Mersey, and \\\"half-speed\\\" was ordered. Five minutes later, we\\nanchored and were touched by a tender. Here we learned what custom-house\\nofficers are for. Every trunk, carpet-bag and satchel had to be opened for\\nthem, and their busy hands were run all through our wardrobes. In order to\\ndetect any smuggling that might be attempted, they will examine every\\ntrunk or chest, &c., from top to bottom. They did not search our pockets,\\nhowever, but short of that they are required to do most anything\\ndisagreeable to the traveler. As it was Sunday, all the shipping was\\ntessellated with the colors of every nation. It is a grand sight to see\\nacres upon acres of ships so profusely decorated with flags that it seems\\nas if the sky was ablaze with their brilliant colors. Our own \\\"Manhattan\\\"\\nsailed proudly into port with twenty-six flags streaming from her\\nmast-head and rigging.\\n\\nAfter we had passed muster, we passed over a kind of bridge or gangway\\nfrom the \\\"Manhattan\\\" into a little steamer that had come down the river to\\nfetch us. How glad we were to leave the good old ship, and bound into the\\narms of another that promised to take us ashore in a very few minutes! It\\nwas a glorious time! We had come to regard the \\\"Manhattan\\\" as a\\nprison-house, from which we had long desired to take our leave, if we only\\ncould. But now that the parting hour had come, how changed our feelings!\\nAs the little boat sailed away, we felt sorry to leave her, and commenced\\nto call her by pet names. \\\"Good-by dear 'Manhattan,' many thanks to you\\nfor carrying us so safely across the deep wide sea,\\\" cried many of us;\\nwhile others gave the customary _three cheers_ and waved their hats.\\nThough we left her empty behind--no friends, and no acquaintances\\nremaining there, still we continued to wave our handkerchiefs at her so\\nlong as we could see her, and have ever since remembered her as the\\nnoblest of all the ships that was in harbor that day. Her, colors seemed\\nthe brightest, and a hundred happy passengers separated that hour that\\nwill never cease to sing her praises. Permit me, kind reader, to add one\\nline more, and in that line make mention of\\n\\n\\n\\nLife-Boat, No. 5.\\n\\n\\nYou may not be able to understand it, or to appreciate how a small party\\nof our passengers came to regard her as almost a sacred thing, but there\\nare a few that know the spell, and who will ever bless the page that tells\\nthe tale! Thither we went when the winds blew harder and the waves rolled\\nhigher, when our heads became heavier and our steps unsteady! She hung at\\nor near the center of the ship, where there was the least rocking or\\nswinging of all places in the whole vessel. During day-time we lay down\\nbeneath her shade, and at night, we would sit by her side relating to\\neach other our feelings and experiences, &c. When sea-sickness had left\\nour company, we agreed upon that place as our general rendezvous by day\\nand by night, for the remainder of the voyage. There we spent our days and\\nthere we met every night! If our sleep was interrupted by a storm at the\\nmidnight hour, thither would we go for relief! A thousand recollections\\ngather around that boat, and bind our hearts together there, as with so\\nmany cords; because our hearts meet there in fond remembrance, therefore\\nwill we never forget the place.\\n\\n\\n\\nStepping Ashore.\\n\\n\\nI had bid adieu to all my acquaintances before leaving the steamer, and\\nconsequently went ashore quite by myself. I did not experience that\\npiercing thrill through my system as I had expected to, on touching the\\nfirm earth again; for we had seen the shore so long before we could land,\\nthat all its novelty had disappeared.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter II.\\n\\nLiverpool.\\n\\n\\n\\nTraveling-bag in hand, which contained my entire wardrobe, I now went In\\nsearch of an hotel. The \\\"Angel Hotel\\\" was soon pointed out to me, and on\\nentering it, I learned that several of my fellow-passengers had already\\ntaken rooms there. It is entirely under the control of ladies, being\\nmanaged by a proprietress and female clerks. The house is an excellent\\none, and the accommodations are first-class. It bears a very appropriate\\nname. After partaking of a hardy supper, I walked out to \\\"take a look at\\nEurope!\\\" At 6:45 p.m., I entered St. Peter's Church, and was conducted to\\na pew. Here, as elsewhere in Europe, the young and the old of both sexes\\noccupy the same seat together. One of the little boys of the family\\noccupying the same pew with me, gave me a hymn-book. A part of the\\nexercises consisted in chanting psalms. The eagle lectant and the Bible\\ncharacters represented in the stained glass of the windows, soon enlisted\\nmy attention, but the meaning of having two birds perched upon a high\\nstand in the middle of the church, I could not unfold, nor was there any\\none about that could tell me. The next day I saw the same bird beside a\\nnoble female form in the museum. \\\"What bird is that?\\\" said I to a\\nby-stander. \\\"That figure,\\\" said he, \\\"is the emblem of Liverpool, and the\\nbird is the _liver_, which abounded down in the pools, and after which the\\nplace was first named.\\\"\\n\\nSt. Luke's was visited after service. The chorister seemed much pleased to\\nmeet an American, and showed me every mark of attention. When asked\\nwhether all the churches of Liverpool had their chancels in the _east_\\nends, he answered in the affirmative. I afterwards found this to be true\\nall over Europe. The dead are buried everywhere so as to face the rising\\nsun.\\n\\nAround St. John's the memorial slabs lie flat upon the graves. IHS, with a\\ncross over the H, is engraved upon the tombstones of the Catholics. These\\nsame letters IHS equivalent to JES or JESUS, are to be seen, in almost\\nevery church and chapel in all Christian Europe. Upon goblets,\\nchrismatories and crosses in the churches they are generally written in\\ngold; while myriads of crosses on headstones in the graveyards bear the\\nsame mystical letters. Various other interpretations are given to them by\\ndifferent writers, but every explanation except the one above given, seems\\nfar-fetched and of doubtful origin, to say the least.\\n\\nIn summer, the sun sets after 8:00 o'clock in the latitude of Liverpool. I\\nsaw some twilight after 10:00 o'clock. The early dawn becomes visible\\nbefore 2:00 o'clock in the morning, and he who wants to see the sun rise,\\nmust content himself with a short night. The Exchange is one of the most\\nelegant buildings of its class in Europe. St. George's Hall contains the\\nlargest organ in England. In front of it are the Colossal Lions and the\\n_Equestion Statue_ of _Prince Albert. Britania_ (England's crest) which\\nsurmounts the dome of the Town Hall, and the Wellington Statue, both face\\n_south_.\\n\\nI had expected to see people dressed differently in Liverpool from what is\\ncustomary in America. In this and a dozen other anticipations I was\\nutterly disappointed. Thus I was surprised at every step, because I was\\nnot surprised.\\n\\nIt was a scource of great grief to me that I could not indulge in\\nrefreshments on Sunday evening. A passenger after landing, is much like a\\npatient after the fever has left him, he is hungry all the time. I had\\nsome American silver in my pocket, which I repeatedly offered to exchange\\nfor cakes, fruits and refreshments, at the numerous stores and stands\\nwhich I passed, but no one was willing to invest in my stock of change.\\nThus I had to suffer both from hunger and thirst, because I did not have\\nthe right kind of money. On Monday I drew my check in English currency,\\nand bought a suitable purse; but I was very awkward for a few days at\\ncounting money. England has the oddest and most irregular money table that\\nI found from there to Egypt, except those of Holland and Germany. Many of\\nthe coins are old and purseworn, so that it is impossible to decipher\\neither the image or the superscription (Matt. XXII. 20), consequently the\\nvalue must he guessed by their size.\\n\\nI spent a great part of the day in the Museum. It contains a large and\\nwell classified collection of natural history, of objects of ancient and\\nmedieval art, of ancient manuscripts, of coins, of pictures, sculpture,\\n&c. Saw the horns of a South African ox, each of which was about four feet\\nlong and five or six inches thick.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Wonderful Clock of Jacob Lovelace.\\n\\n\\nIn the second story of the building stands a magnificent clock, weighing\\nhalf a ton. Its case is about five feet long by three feet wide, and ten\\nfeet high. Upon its face are seven hands. It is a very old and complicated\\nmachine, and near it in a frame I found the following description: \\\"It is\\na the work of Jacob Lovelace, of Exeter, ornamented with Oriental figures\\nand finely executed paintings, guilted by fretworks.\\\" The movements are\\n1st--A moving Panorama descriptive of Day and Night, Day is beautifully\\nrepresented by Apollo in his Car, drawn by four spirited coursers,\\naccompanied by the twelve hours, and Diana in her Car, drawn by stags\\nattended by twelve hours, represents Night. 2nd--Two Guilt Figures in\\nRoman costume who turn their heads and salute with their swords as the\\nPanorama revolves; and also move in the same manner while the bells are\\nringing. 3rd--A Perpectual Almanac showing the day of the month on a\\nsemi-circular plate, the Index returning to the first day of the month on\\nthe close of each month, without alteration even in leap years, regulated\\nonly once in 130 years. 4th--A Circle, the Index of which shows the day of\\nthe week with its appropriate planet. 5th--A Perpetual Almanac showing the\\ndays of the Month Weekly and the Equation of time. 6th--A Circle showing\\nthe leap year, the Index revolving once in four years. 7th--A Time Piece\\nthat strikes the hours and chimes the quarters, on the face of which the\\nwhole of the twenty-four hours (twelve day and twelve night) are shown and\\nregulated; within this circle the sun is seen in his course, with the time\\nof rising and setting by an Horison receding or advancing as the days\\nlengthen and shorten, and under is seen the moon showing her different\\nquarters, phases, age, &c. 8th--Two female figures, one on each side of\\nthe Dial Plate, representing Fame and Terpsichore, who move in time when\\nthe organ plays. 9th--A Movement regulating the Clock as a repeater to\\nstrike or be silent. 10th--Saturn, the God of Time, who beats in movement\\nwhile the organ plays. 11th--A circle of the face shows the names of eight\\ncelebrated tunes played by the organ in the interior of the cabinet every\\nfour hours. 12th--A Belfry with six ringers, who ring a merry peal _ad\\nlibitum_; the interior of this part of the cabinet is ornamented with\\nbeautiful paintings, representing some of the principal ancient Buildings\\nof the city of Exeter. 13th--Connected with the organ there is a Bird\\nOrgan, which plays when required. This unrivaled piece of mechanism was\\nperfectly cleaned and repaired by _W. Frost_, of Exeter, a self-taught\\nartist. Jacob Lovelace, the maker, ended his days in great poverty in\\nExeter, at the age of sixty years, having been thirty-four years in\\ncompleting it. This museum also contains glass of the Roman period--A.D.\\n100-500. The best specimens are a little greenish, but quite clear. One of\\nthe Egyptian mummies is wrapped up by a bandage of cloth, that was woven\\n3,000 years ago. It is still in a good state of preservation.\\n\\nTuesday, July 6th. The Sultan of Zanzibar, who was on a tour of\\ninspection, started from the North-western Hotel at about 10:00 o'clock to\\ndrive out to the docks. He was accompanied by two natives from his own\\ncountry, and the mayor and thirteen British cavaliers. The appearance, in\\nLiverpool, of this South African dignitary, created a considerable\\nsensation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter III.\\n\\nChester.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt 10:45 I left Liverpool for Chester. Edge Hill Tunnel, which is about a\\nmile or a mile and a quarter in length, was passed in five minutes. Grain\\nripens from one to two months later here, than in Pennsylvania. The\\nfarmers were busy making hay, and the wheat still retained a dark green\\ncolor. Harvesting is done in August and September. Wheat, rye, barley and\\npotatoes are the staple products. No corn is cultivated in northern\\nEngland. Wood is so scarce and dear in Great Britain, as well as upon the\\ncontinent, that the farmers can not afford to build rail-fences.\\nHedge-fences, walls and ditches, therefore, take their places in every\\nEuropean country. All this is new to the American when he first comes to\\nthe Old World. Pass some fields of clover still in bloom. See men mow with\\nthe same \\\"German\\\" scythes that we use in America. We reached Chester\\nbefore noon. This is one of the oldest cities, if not the oldest in the\\ncountry. Here one sees the England of his dreams, the England he so long\\ndesired to see, and which now presents to his gaze, as it were in a focus,\\nboth the monuments and the rubbish of many ages. It was once a great\\nmilitary station of the Romans in Britain, who called it the City of\\nLegions. King \\u00c6thelfrith reduced it to ruins in the year 607, and it\\nremained \\\"a waste chester\\\" (a waste castra or fortification) for three\\ncenturies. The Danes made its walls a stronghold against Alfred and\\n\\u00c6thelred, and the Lady of the Mercians, who was the daughter of Alfred and\\nthe wife of \\u00c6thelred, recognized the importance of the place, and built it\\nup again. It was the last city in England to hold out against William the\\nConqueror. During the Civil Wars the city adhered to the royal cause, and\\nwas besieged and taken by the Parliamentary forces in 1645. The _Phoenix\\nTower_ bears the incription: _King Charles stood on this tower September_\\n24, 1645, _and saw his army defeated on Rowton Moor_.\\n\\n_The Rows_ are a very curious feature of the two principal streets running\\nat right angles to each other. Besides the ordinary walks or pavements of\\nthese streets, there is a continuous covered gallery through the front of\\nthe second story. Some one has said, \\\"Great is the puzzle of the stranger\\nas to whether the roadway is down in the cellar, or he is upstairs on the\\nlanding, or the house has turned outside of the window.\\\" On this \\\"upstairs\\nstreet,\\\" as some call it, are situated all the first-class shops, the\\nothers being in the lower story on a level with the road. Picture to\\nyourself a row of houses having porches in the second story but not in the\\nfirst, and you have a correct idea of the Rows of Chester. To compare them\\nto the Arcades of Rue de Rivoli in Paris, is a mistake, as they do not\\nresemble those more, than a porch over a pavement resembles one in the\\nsecond story.\\n\\nThe Cathedral is a grand old church. It was built in the latter part of\\nthe twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth centuries, upon the same\\nsite where two of its predecessors had already crumbled into decay. \\\"_St.\\nJohn's Church_ is even more ancient than the Cathedral, having been built\\nin the eleventh century. I shall never forget its weather-beaten walls and\\nits mossy roof. In many places, the thickness of the walls is greatly\\nreduced by the rain and hail that have washed and beaten against it so\\nlong. In my rambles through Chester I had the good fortune of meeting and\\nforming the acquaintance of an Irish Catholic Priest and a wine merchant\\nfrom Wolverhampton, two intelligent and amiable gentlemen, who taught me\\nmuch about those curious relics still found in heaps among the ruins of\\nold Chester. At about 2:00 o'clock we stood upon the high square: tower of\\nSt. John's (thirty-five feet each side at the top) amidst the elderberries\\nand grass which flourish at that giddy height. Looking at the town from\\nthis elevation, one gets no idea of its _unique_ features, as the numerous\\nslate-roofs give it the appearance of a modern town. The descent was made\\nwith difficulty, land even attended with some danger, for the long wooden\\nstairs or ladders are becoming shaky and a break of one of its steps\\nmight precepitate one from such a height that instant death was the most\\ndesirable alternative. But who would not become bold, or even sometimes\\nmore that, amid such surroundings! When one says we _can't_ get there,\\nanother is sure to declare that we _must_ get there! \\\"What! would you come\\nso far to see antiquity, and then count your steps how near you would\\napproach her?\\\" Eight bells constitute the peal in this venerable old\\ntower. Near by, stand the ivy-clad and moss-covered ruins of portions of\\nthe sacred edifices that date back, even to the earlier ages of the\\nChristian era, and from among the dust and rubbish are picked up the\\nbroken images of hideous-looking idols that were the ornaments (?) of the\\ntemples once standing there. We found a large collection of those\\nghastly-looking idols piled away in the crypt of the church. Whether the\\nemblems of Druid, or Christian worship, these \\\"images cut out of stone\\\"\\nevidently represent an age, in which the heart was subdued by\\nsuperstitious fear rather than by \\\"_love_.\\\"\\n\\nThe Walls merit especial attention. They still surround the city\\ncompletely, and form, in a certain sense, the proudest and most admirable\\npromenade that the world affords anywhere. From it are obtained the best\\nviews of the Cathedral and of the country around. The ascent to it is made\\nby a flight of steps on the north side of the East-gate. A ditch or canal\\nabout twenty-five feet wide, runs all around the wall and used to render\\nthe battering of the wall a matter of extreme difficulty before the\\ninvention of powder and the introduction of fire-arms. The pavement, on\\ntop of the wall, is four and a half to six feet wide, and skirted on both\\nsides by thinner walls; that on the outside being about four or five feet\\nhigh. From behind this wall the soldiers would hurl spears, javelins, &c.,\\nat the attacking enemy, and keep them in check. How things have changed\\nsince that time! Now this walk forms the peaceful and delightful promenade\\nof the private citizens. Here meet the young and the gay, fashion displays\\nits gaudiest colors, and lovers take their \\\"moonlight strolls.\\\"\\n\\nSuch is the use now made of the Walls of Chester! America has no walled\\ncities; Europe has but few without walls. In the early history of Europe,\\nevery town even had its walls. In many places where the walls have almost\\ndisappeared, there are still remaining the gates of the city. At those\\npoints the walls were made doubly strong, and high and impregnable towers\\nbuilt over them, in which were stationed strong guards \\\"to defend the\\ngates.\\\" Then no stranger could enter without some kind of \\\"pass\\\" from\\nrecognized authorities. Did not the system of \\\"pass-ports\\\" which has been\\nhanded down to our day, but which seems to be falling into disuse even in\\nEurope, have its origin in this way? At 5:40 I left Chester for\\nBirmingham. On our way we passed Crewe, one of the great railroad centers\\nof England. At this station _five hundred_ trains pass each other every\\ntwenty-four hours.\\n\\nWe arrived at Birmingham at 8:45 p.m. Between Wolverhampton and Birmingham\\nlies the great ore and manufacturing district of England. Ore-beds and\\nsmoke-stacks cover all the area some thirty miles long and sixteen miles\\nwide, except that occupied by the miserable cottages (some of them mere\\nhovels) of the laborers. Looking at this immense area from the cars, it\\npresents the appearance of one continuous town. No wonder that England can\\naccommodate a population of some twenty odd millions on an area but little\\nmore than that of Pennsylvania, when poor humanity is thus crowded\\ntogether. In the cars, I had formed the acquaintance of a sociable party\\nof ladies and gentlemen, who pointed out places to me, and instructed me\\nconcerning the manners and social habits of the people. From Liverpool\\nhither, I found very small brick houses the rule and spacious buildings\\nlike our Pennsylvania farm houses, the exception. Barns, I saw none; small\\nstables supply their places even on large farms. We saw several very fine\\ncastles by the way, however.\\n\\nBirmingham is known as \\\"the toy-shop of Europe,\\\" \\\"but most of the toys are\\nfor children of larger growth.\\\" One can nowhere see richer sights than in\\nthe show-rooms of many of these shops. One that I visited, a glass\\nshow-room containing chandeliers priced upwards of a thousand dollars, and\\nall varieties of fancy-wares of every description, had large mirrors at\\nthe ends of the room, covering the entire walls, and producing the\\ngrandest effect conceivable. The objects in the room were thus infinitely\\nmultiplied in both directions, so that whichever way one turned his face,\\nglittering glassware was seen \\\"as far as the eye could reach.\\\"\\n\\nSuch sights are simply bewildering! It is a little difficult to gain\\nadmittance to the manufacturing departments of many of these places, but\\nto literary characters that represent \\\"newspapers,\\\" the doors are\\ngenerally opened quite readily. In hunting these shops, I discovered a\\ngreat want of system in the naming and numbering of the streets of this\\notherwise quite elegant city. I had passed a certain street twice, from\\nend to end, in search of a particular number. Upon further inquiry, I\\nlearned that what I had considered one street, was numbered and named as\\ntwo, though there was not the slightest deviation from a perfectly\\nstraight line at any point of it. To make bad worse, the houses were\\ncounted and numbered upwards on one side of the street, and downwards on\\nthe other side. In such a city the stranger must find places by\\n_speculation!_\\n\\nStrange things one meets at every step in Europe, and soon gets so used\\nto it, that it seems the strangest to see something that is not strange;\\nbut oddities are perhaps no plentier on one side of the Atlantic than they\\nare on the other, and are equally amusing everywhere. Upon the burial\\nground of St. Philip's, stands a monument in honor and memory of a wife\\nthat died at the age of fifty-nine years, which has a bee-hive and the\\ninscription: \\\"She looked well to the ways of her household, and did not\\neat the bread of idleness.\\\"\\n\\nA number of fine statues adorn some of the public squares. One of these, a\\nbronze statue to _Peel_ faces _east_; while _Priestley's_ marble statue\\nfaces _south_.\\n\\nThe first thing that arrests the tourist's attention on arriving at\\nBirmingham, is its magnificent railroad station, the largest and finest\\nthat I had thus far met with in England. As it was late in the evening\\nwhen I arrived, I had no time to pay much attention to it until the next\\nday. The part entered by the trains is about 1,050 feet long and 200 feet\\nwide, all in one apartment. This part is sprung by forty-two immense iron\\narches, supporting a roof half of whose covering is glass. The numerous\\ntracks are separated by platforms running lengthwise through the building,\\nfrom which the passengers enter the cars. In order to avoid the danger of\\ncrossing the tracks, there is a fine foot-bridge, eighteen feet wide,\\nrunning across the tracks above the reach of the locomotive stacks. From\\nthis bridge, stairs descent to the platforms between the tracks, as before\\nmentioned. Three hundred trains pass through this station every\\ntwenty-four hours. An officer receives and dismisses these trains by means\\nof a signal-bell. The ticket-offices are in the second story of a large\\nbuilding adjoining.\\n\\n\\n\\nRailroads in Europe.\\n\\n\\nThere are no \\\"conductors\\\" upon the trains after they leave the \\\"stations\\\"\\n(which, by the way, I never heard any one call depots, in Europe) but\\nofficers are stationed at the head of every stairway to punch the tickets.\\nFive minutes before any particular train leaves, the ticket-office is\\nclosed and the conductors pass through the cars and inspect the tickets.\\nIf any one did come into a wrong car or train, there is still time left to\\ncorrect the mistake. Tickets are not collected till one's destination is\\nreached, where they _must_ be delivered to the door-keeper on leaving the\\nstation. Without it, a passenger is a prisoner. \\\"Railroading\\\" is so\\nperfectly systemized in Europe, that it is quite impossible either to\\ncheat a company, or to be cheated out of one's time by missing trains.\\nThere is little danger of missing a train even in countries where one can\\nnot speak the language. The cars are divided into compartments _(Ger.\\nAbtheilungen)_ of two seats or benches each, running across the car, with\\ndoors at the sides. In 1st Class cars, the seats are finely cushioned and\\nthe compartments are about as inviting in appearance as our Palace cars;\\nin 2nd Class cars the seats are comfortable but common; but 3rd Class cars\\nhave only bare wooden benches. There are in some countries, 4th Class\\ncars, which have no seats. I did not see any of those, but from what I\\nlearned of others, they must resemble our freight cars. In those, too,\\npassengers have the privilege of standing or sitting down, according to\\ntheir taste or comfort. Tickets to 1st Class cars cost about the same as\\nin this country, 2nd Class tickets cost three-fourths, and 3rd Class about\\nhalf as much.\\n\\nIn hilly sections of the country, the railways generally cross the wagon\\nroads by bridges; but wherever the two kinds of roads intersect each other\\non a level, travel on the latter is interrupted by gates and watchmen, who\\npermit no one to pass while a train is approaching the crossing. Thus\\nevery railway crossing in Europe is superintended day and night by\\nwatchmen. These watchmen are noticed by signal-bells, at the departure of\\nevery train running in the direction of their crossings. Under such a\\nsystem, accidents are impossible. Even the doors of each \\\"compartment\\\" are\\nbarred by the conductors before the trains are dismissed, and will not be\\nopened by the conductors of the next station, until the train stands\\nstill. The tickets, besides containing the ordinary matter on tickets in\\nthis country, have also the price printed upon them.\\n\\nSome of the stations of the Old World, are buildings of extraordinary\\nbeauty and magnificence.\\n\\nThe grandest structure of this kind, is, probably, the station (Ger.\\n_Station_ or _Bahnhof_, Italian _Stazione_) of Stuttgart. Among many\\nothers, might also be mentioned the stations of Paris, of Turin, of Milan,\\nand of Rome; but the Great Western Station of London, lakes the palm of\\nthose all, for magnificence, beauty and convenience combined. What the\\nstation at Clapham (seven miles above London) looks like, I do not know,\\nbut it is said, that from 1,000 to 1,200 trains run through it every\\ntwenty-four hours! What multitudes of people must be streaming over the\\nplatforms and past the windows of the ticket-offices of such a station,\\nevery day! At Birmingham and at Crewe, where 300 and 500 trains pass\\ndaily, the swarming thousands remind one of _floods_ and _inundations_,\\nbut how must it look at Clapham?\\n\\nJuly 7th, 3:40 p.m. Leave Birmingham for Stratford on the Avon (pron.\\n[=a]'von).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter IV.\\n\\nStratford-upon-Avon.\\n\\n\\n\\nArrived at 5:00 p.m., July 7th. It had been my intention to pay this place\\nonly a brief visit, giving but a glance at \\\"The Poet's\\\" home and\\nbirthplace, and then start on foot for Coventry; but I soon found that\\nStratford possesses more charms than I had anticipated. Shakespeare's fame\\nhas an influence over his native town, that is simply marvelous.\\n\\nThe thousands of tourists that come from every land, and from every clime,\\n_to see the scenes that the poet saw, and breath the same air that he\\nbreathed,_ make the place one of the most popular resorts of literary\\npilgrims, that can be found anywhere.\\n\\nThe buildings of Stratford are small and low, as is the rule, rather than\\nthe exception, in English towns and villages. Many are covered with tiles,\\nbut the thatch roof is also very common here. This consists of a mixture\\nof straw and earth, often more than a foot in thickness, and covered with\\nmoss and grass. Notwithstanding this, both the houses and the streets are\\nkept remarkably clean and inviting; so much so, that I felt nowhere else\\nso soon and so perfectly at home as here. Its people seem to be possessed\\nof every virtue, and pre\\u00ebminent among them all, is that of hospitality\\nwhich seems to be blooming in the hearts of all its citizens to-day, as\\ndid poetry in the mind of Shakespeare three hundred years ago.\\n\\nThe streets of this town are kept as clean as a floor, by sweepers\\nwatching the streets all day long, collecting and carrying away all the\\nrefuse matter. One day, I felt ill at ease about a small piece of paper\\nthat had become a superfluity in my pocket, but which I was afraid to\\nthrow upon the street, as it would there seem as much out of place as if I\\nshould drop it upon the carpet in a parlor. I passed along the pavement\\nwith it, until I met a street-sweeper, and there threw it upon his heap\\nwith a nod, which he reciprocated with a bow.\\n\\nOn entering Stratford, my foot first tended toward\\n\\n\\n\\nShakespeare's Birthplace,\\n\\n\\na large two-story house, about fifty feet long, having three large\\ndormer-windows and two chimneys, one of them running up on the outside of\\nthe house.\\n\\nThe custodian takes the visitor through every apartment of it, giving the\\nhistory of the same and of numerous articles of furniture and Shakesperian\\nrelics, &c., which constitute a considerable museum.\\n\\nWhen William Shakespeare's father was a \\\"well-to-do\\\" man, he occupied the\\nwhole house; but after he had become poor, the east end was rented to a\\nhotel-keeper, and he lived in the middle part only, which has later been\\nused as a butcher-shop.\\n\\n\\\"On the 16th of September, 1847, it (the building) was put up for sale by\\nthe magniloquent Mr. George Robins, and in consequence of a strong appeal\\nto the feelings of the people, made through the public press, by which a\\n_National Subscription_ was raised for the purpose; this house was bought\\nat the bidding of Mr. Peter Cunningham, for something more than 3,000\\npounds sterling, and was placed under Trustees on behalf of the Nation.\\\"\\n\\nSpace will not permit me to make mention of more than a few of the many\\ninteresting books, manuscripts, works of art, antiques and relics, found\\nin this Library and Museum. Among them stands the desk at which little\\n\\\"Willie\\\" sat at school, also a ring which he wore at his thumb (later in\\nlife), and upon which are engraved the letters \\\"W.S.\\\" and a \\\"true lover's\\nknot.\\\" I spent nearly an hour here, a studying how things looked in\\nShakespeare's time. The ground floors of the house, are covered with\\nflagstones broken in varied forms, as accident would have it, while the\\nrough massive timbers of the floors above stand out unpainted and\\nunplastered. After taking a pleasant walk, with a gay party, through the\\ngarden, in which are cultivated all the flowers of which Shakespeare\\nspeaks in his works, and, (I must not fail also to mention), after having\\ntaken our turns in sitting upon _Shakespeare's chair_, I bade the sociable\\ncompany \\\"good-by!\\\" and started for\\n\\n\\n\\nShottery,\\n\\n\\n\\\"a genuine country village, consisting of a few straggling farm-houses\\nand brick and timber cottages, standing apart from each other in their old\\ngardens and orchard-crofts. Simple, old-fashioned, and almost untouched by\\nthe innovations of modern life, we are here amidst the charmed past of\\nShakespeare's time.\\\" Here is still to be seen, the cottage in which was\\nborn and lived Anne Hathaway, the wife of Wm. Shakespeare. This village\\nlies about a mile from Stratford, and is approached by a pleasant walk\\nacross quiet and fertile fields and pasture lands, the same path along\\nwhich \\\"Willie\\\" used to steal when he went a-wooing his Anne. The Hathaway\\ncottage is a large old-fashioned thatch-roofed building--very plain but\\nvery homely. The clumsy string-lifted wooden door-latches, and the wooden\\npins fixing the framing, and which have never been cut off, but stick up\\nsome inches from the wall, are still all there. It was dusk before I got\\nthere. My rap at the door was responded to by the appearance of an old\\nlady custodian, a descendent of the Hathaway family, who immediately\\nbusied herself to light a tallow candle. That being successfully\\naccomplished, she commenced her story by pointing out the old hearth, and\\nexplaining the kitchen arrangements of olden times. Among the old articles\\nof furniture, is a plain wooden settee or bench which used to stand\\noutside against the house near the door, during the summer, and which, as\\ntradition, has it, was Willie's and Anne's courting settee. Pictures of\\ntheir courtships hang against the walls, exhibiting styles and fashions\\nwell in keeping with the antique furniture of the room. An old carved\\nbed-stead of the Shakespeare era, stands in the room above. Here the\\ncustodian offered me a book of autographs, asking me to sign my name, as\\nhas been customary since October 4th, 1846. Six books have been filled\\nwith autographs, since that time. Among the signatures I saw one Emma R.,\\nJuly 24th, 1866. \\\"This,\\\" said the custodian, \\\"is the signature of the\\nQueen of the Sandwich Islands.\\\"\\n\\nHenry W. Longfellow's signature, who was here with his brother (and\\nfamilies), June 23rd, 1868, and that of Chas. Dickens, here in 1852, were\\nalso pointed out.\\n\\nThe old lady would not let me go away without having taken a drink from\\n\\\"the spring where Anne used to drink.\\\" After presenting me with \\\"lavender\\\"\\nand \\\"rosemary\\\" for mementoes, and a button-hole boquet consisting of a\\nfine rose and buds, for immediate display, she wished me god-speed on my\\njourney, and I retraced the path across the fields to Stratford.\\n\\nNew Place, the Home of Shakespeare, is the most charming place in all\\nStratford. The extensive yard and garden which belonged to the property in\\nShakespeare's time, had been partially cut up in lots and covered with\\nhouses; but these have all been removed again, and the grounds laid out\\ninto walks, lawns and flower beds, as the poet was wont to have them. His\\nyard and garden covered an area of about two acres. The gentleman who has\\ncharge of the property now, exerts himself to the utmost, to make the\\nsurroundings pleasant and inviting, aiming particularly to plant the same\\ntrees and flowers that the poet had planted there, and to keep his\\nfavorite trees, or lineal successors of them, in the same sites. Among the\\nornamental trees and flowers, he pointed out a number that he obtained\\nfrom Vick, the florist, of Rochester, N.Y.\\n\\nShakespeare was buried in the Church of the Holy Trinity. His wife, his\\nonly daughter Susanna and her husband, Thomas Nash, lie with him in the\\nsame row, immediately in front of the altar-rails. His tombstone bears the\\nfollowing inscription:\\n\\n GOOD FREND FOR JESVS SAKE FORBEARE,\\n TO DIGG THE BVST ENCLOASED HEARE:\\n BLESE BE YE MAN YT SPARES THES STONES,\\n AND CVRST BE HE YT MOVES MY BONES.\\n\\nThe only typographical peculiarity not rendered here, is the grouping\\ntogether of HE in HEARE and TH in THES, after the fashion of monograms.\\n\\nThis church also contains a half-length figure of Shakespeare, painted\\nafter nature. There is evidence extant that it had already taken its place\\nagainst the wall in the year 1623. Beneath is inscribed:\\n\\n Judicio pylivm genio socratem, arte maronem,\\n Terra tegit, popvlvs m\\u00e6ret, Olympvs Habet[A]\\n Stay, passenger; why goest thov by so fast?\\n Read, if thov canst, whom enviovs death hath plast\\n Within this monvment; Shakespeare, with whom\\n Quick natvre dide; whose name doth deck ys. tombe\\n Far more than cost; sith all yt. he hath writt\\n Leaves living art bvt page to serve his witt.\\n\\n Obiit.

Ap.\\n\\n[Footnote A: In judgment a Nestor, in genius a Socrates, in art a Virgil.\\nThe earth covers him, the people mourn for him, Olympus has him.]\\n\\nOf the Guildhall, the Grammar School, and the beautiful Avon, with their\\nhundred sweet associations, I dare say nothing more. After a stay of three\\ndays, during which time I had recovered from the effects of the severe\\nstrain and close application of mind and body, by which both had suffered\\nexhaustion, and been driven almost to the verge of prostration, in the\\nmuseum at Liverpool and the ruins of Chester; I started on way to Warwick\\n(pron. War'rick) and Coventry. As my purpose was to walk the whole\\ndistance, about twenty miles, I sent my sachel by rail, to the former\\nplace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter V.\\n\\nStratford to Coventry.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the walk referred to by the two Englishmen who laid a wager as to\\nwhich was the finest walk in England. \\\"After the money had been put up,\\none named the walk from Stratford to Coventry, and the other from Coventry\\nto Stratford. How the umpire decided the case, is not recorded.\\\" It was\\nlate in the afternoon on Saturday, July 10th, when I bade adieu to\\nStratford, and went away rejoicing, in the hope of soon seeing the\\nbeauties of England's most charming agricultural section.\\n\\nAfter two hours, I entered Charlecote Park, where I disturbed several\\nherds of deer, some hundred head in all. From this park, as lame tradition\\nhas it, Shakespeare once stole deer, and became an exile for the crime!\\n\\nOn Sunday forenoon I attended service at\\n\\n\\n\\nSt. Mary's Church,\\n\\n\\nin Warwick. The choir, lady chapel and chapter-house are among the purest\\nexamples of Decorated work, and date from 1394. The tomb of Richard\\nBeauchamp (Bee'cham) in the Lady Chapel, is considered the most splendid\\nin the kingdom, with the single exception of that of Henry VII. in\\nWestminster Abbey.\\n\\nA very high tower stands over the entrance door, at the west end of the\\nchurch. The organ and choir (at the same end) rendered the finest music\\nthat I heard in England. There were several very highly cultivated voices\\namong those of the half dozen ladies that occupied the space in front of\\nthe organ.\\n\\nEverything else about the services is eminently examplery of the olden\\ntimes. Preaching is the least important part of the exercises. Pulpit\\noratory finds no place here. Singing, praying and readings are the leading\\nfeature of worship in the English Church in general, and of old churches\\nlike this, in particular. Such exercises seem to be eminently appropriate\\nfor a people whose hearts and minds are almost petrified in civil and\\nreligious forms and ceremonies. The step which the English Church took\\naway from Catholicism, must have been an extremely short one, if it was a\\nstep at all. This congregation still turn their faces toward the east,\\nduring a certain part of their recitals, and bow ceremoniously, in\\nconcert, as often, as they mention the name of \\\"Jesus Christ.\\\"\\n\\nTwo miles from Warwich, is Leamington, (L[)e]m'ington), a fashionable\\n\\\"spa,\\\" which I visited in the afternoon. It is a very pretty town, and\\nemphatically modern in style; presenting nothing that is anti-American in\\nappearance, except its clusters of chimney-tops, so common everywhere in\\nEurope. As soon as one has crossed the Atlantic he will seldom longer see\\nsingle square tops built upon the chimneys, but each apartment of the\\nhouse has its own chimney; all these converge, but do not meet before\\ncoming out of the roof, so that from two to six or eight tops generally\\nkeep each other company on the house-tops.\\n\\nAt 3:45 p.m., I started from Warwick for Coventry. The road leading from\\nthis place to Coventry is an excellent turnpike, just as that is from\\nStratford hither, and has a splendid gravel walk for pedestrians on one\\nside, and a riding path for those on horseback, on the other side.\\n\\nFive miles brought me to Kenilworth Castle. Great must have been its\\nglories when Elizabeth came here in 1575 to visit Liecester. Cromwell\\ndismantled it, and laid waste the gardens around it, and the tooth of time\\nhas been gnawing at it ever since, but it is magnificent even in its\\nruins. \\\"Go round about it, tell the towers thereof, and mark well its\\nbulwarks, if you would know what a mighty fortress it must have been when\\nit held out for half a year against Henry III. in 1266, or what a lordly\\npalace when it thrice welcomed Elizabeth to its hospitalities, three\\nhundred years later.\\\"\\n\\nA quarter or half a mile further on, is a fine church, and nearby an\\nivy-covered arch. A passing gentleman told me this had been the entrance\\nto an ancient abbey; and others said it was a part of the ruined Castle of\\nKenilworth.\\n\\nIt was 6:00 o'clock when I left here, and had five miles more to\\nCoventry. A mile and a half on this side of that city lie the extensive\\npossessions of Lord Leigh. This wealthy peer owns here, in one stretch,\\nabout twenty square miles of the finest and most fertile land in the\\nworld.\\n\\nAbout a mile from Coventry I encountered an enormous stream of pedestrians\\ncoming out of the city to take their evening walk. The promenade, which is\\nabout ten feet wide at that place, was so thronged with the gay young\\ncouples, that I found it impossible to walk against the mighty stream, and\\ntook the middle of the street. After. I had entered the gate, I found the\\npavements on both sides of the road becoming more and more crowded, all\\nbound for a pleasant grassy grove known as \\\"the lovers quarters.\\\"\\n\\nIt is difficult to make estimates under such circumstances, but there can\\nhardly have been less than 5,000 to 10,000 persons upon the promenade that\\nevening.\\n\\n\\n\\nCoventry.\\n\\n\\nCoventry is remarkable for its elegant parish churches, which are among\\nthe finest in England.\\n\\n\\\"St. Michael's Church is one of the largest (some say _the_ largest) and\\nnoblest parish churches in England.\\\" Its steeple built between 1373 and\\n1395, is 303 feet high. The church was finished in 1450, when Henry VI.\\nheard mass there. The second and third of the \\\"three tall spires\\\" of\\nCoventry are that of Trinity Church and of Christ Church. St. John's is\\nfamous for its magnificent western window.\\n\\nCoventry is well worth, a visit on account of those famous churches.\\n\\nI was accompanied to those fine edifices by two precociously intelligent\\nlittle beauties, (of seven and eleven years respectively), whose gayety\\nand cheer fulness not only rendered their society very accept able to \\\"a\\nstranger in a strange land;\\\" but the simple fact of their being permitted\\nto accompany so perfect a stranger to all parts of the city, showed how\\nmuch trust some foreigners have in Amercans, and consequently, to what\\nextent one may put confidence in them. Such incidents are very pleasant\\nand encouraging to the lonely pilgrim and may be made a matter of almost\\ndaily occurence by any social but circumspective traveler. The traveling\\npublic in Europe are so social, and etiquette so free, that the tourist\\ncan at every step form the acquaintance of some one who is bound for the\\nsame church, museum or pleasure garden and thus be continually enjoying\\nthe benefits of intelligent and cheerful company.\\n\\nOn Monday noon, July 12th, I left Coventry by rail, to return to\\n\\n\\n\\nWarwick via Leamington.\\n\\n\\nAt 3:30 p.m., I had passed through the many elegant apartments of Warwick\\nCastle, and stood at the top of its tower, overlooking the wood groves,\\nand flower garden, occupying the 70 acres of ground belonging to that\\nprincely mansion.\\n\\nAmong the ornamental trees, our guide pointed out \\\"one that Queen Victoria\\nplanted with her own hands.\\\" Scott calls Warwich Castle \\\"the farest\\nmonument of ancient and chivalrous splender which yet remains uninjured by\\ntime.\\\"\\n\\nIt is said to have been founded in the 10th century, destroyed in the\\n13th, and restored by Thomas de Beauchamp in the 14th. It has been\\npreserved so well that it looks almost like a new palace, to-day\\n\\n\\n\\nOxford\\n\\n\\nwith its score of colleges scattered all over the city, constituting the\\nworld renowned University of the same name, was \\\"done\\\" the next day, but\\ndone in a hurry. It is a depressing business to pass by so much, giving\\nbut a glance here and there, and not be able to see so many things more at\\nleisure, Magnificent libraries and museums, grand churches and chapels,\\nand extensive buildings and botanical gardens, were rushed through and\\npassed by, as if the charm and beauty of Oxford's scenes consisted rather\\nin making the images of them flit in quick succession across the retina of\\nthe eye, than in examining, studying and contemplating them.\\n\\nMerton College, founded 1264, contains a library 600 years old. Many of\\nits large and rare books are chained to their respective shelves, like\\ndogs to their kennels; and with chains too, of sufficient strength to\\ncheck any canine's wanderings. Christ Church I entered by the Tower-Gate,\\nso named after the great bell contained in the cupola of the tower over\\nit. This bell weighs about 17,000 pounds. The quadrangle inclosed by the\\nbuildings of this college, is \\\"the largest and the most noble in Oxford.\\\"\\nIts dimensions are 264 by 200 feet, or nearly an acre and a half in\\nextent. The \\\"Hall\\\" is 113 feet by forty, and fifty feet in height. \\\"The\\nroof is of carved oak, with very elegant pendants, profusely decorated\\nwith the armorial bearings and badges of King Henry VIII. and Cardinal\\nWolsey, and has the date 1529.\\\" Its bay window at the end of the dais with\\nits rich grained vault of fan-tracery, is admired by every one.\\n\\nChrist Church Meadow, with its \\\"Broad Walk\\\" one and a quarter mile in\\ncircuit, and Addison walk, near St. Mary Magdalen College, are among the\\nmost bewitching promenades that can be found anywhere, while \\\"the manner\\nin which High street opens upon the view, in walking from the Botanic\\nGarden, is probably one of the finest things of the kind in Europe.\\\"\\n\\nOxford is all history and poetry. There is a tradition that upon the top\\nof the elegant tower St. Mary Magdalen, formerly on every May-day morning,\\nat four o'clock, was sung a requiem for the soul of Henry VII., the\\nreigning monarch at the time of its erection. The custom of chanting a\\nhymn beginning with\\n\\n \\\"Te Deum Patrem colimus,\\n Te laudibus prosequimur,\\\"\\n\\nIn the same place is still preserved, on the same morning of each year,\\nat five o'clock.\\n\\nThe dark lantern which Guy Fawks used in the Gunpowder Plot in 1605, and a\\npicture of the conspirators are contained in the New Museum.\\n\\nFrom Oxford I went directly to London by a fast line, which occupied less\\nthan two hours in making the journey. From the cars, we saw Windsor\\nCastle, with its colors raised, meaning that the Queen was there.\\n\\nWe also passed some large patches of flowers in the fields, which were\\ncultivated for the London flower-market.\\n\\nForeigners in general have a great passion for flowers. While ladies wear\\nthem in their hair, upon their bosoms, and carry them in their hand, the\\ngentlemen will carry button-hole bouquets, and many even stick them upon\\ntheir hats. They are fashionable with all ages and all classes. From\\nblooming maidenhood to gray-headed age, all will adorn themselves with\\nflowers. The English seem to _cultivate_ the most flowers, while the\\nFrench and the Italians, and (lately?) the Germans, _wear most_ upon their\\npersons. In England, every available spot of spare soil about the yard, is\\nplanted with flowers; on the continent, all the fashionable restaurants\\nand cafes must daily be supplied with fresh bouquets, with which these\\nhalls are decorated in lavish profusion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VI.\\n\\nLondon.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe now approach London, the mighty mistress of the commercial world, the\\nmost populous city on our globe. Here, certers the trade of all nations\\nhere, is transacted the business of the world. If you would know how it\\nlooks where concentration of business has reached its climax, then come to\\nLondon. Many of its streets are so crowded with omnibuses, wagons,\\ndray-carts, &c., that it is almost Impossible for a pedestrian to cross\\nthem. When the principal streets intersect each other, the bustle and\\ntumult of trade is so great, that it becomes a dangerous undertaking to\\nattempt to effect a crossing at such a square.\\n\\nFor the protection and accommodation of those on foot, the squares are\\nprovided with little platforms elevated a step above the surface of the\\nroad and surrounded with a thick row of stone posts between these, the\\npedestrian can enter, but they shield him from the clanger of being tread\\nunder the feet of horses, or run over by vehicles. Here one stands\\nperfectly safe, even when everything is confusion for an acre around. As\\nsoon as an opportunity opens, he runs to the next landing; and thus\\ncontinues, from landing to landing, until the opposite side of the square\\nis reached. It often requires five minutes to accomplish this feat. It\\nhas been estimated that no less than 20,000 teams and equestrians, and\\n107,000 pedestrians cross London Bridge every twenty-four hours. By police\\narrangement, slow traffic travel at the sides and the quick in the center.\\nIt is 928 feet long and fifty-four wide. Not only are the streets crowded,\\nbut beneath the houses and streets, in the dark bosom of the earth, there\\nis a net-work of\\n\\n\\n\\nUnderground Railroads,\\n\\n\\nextending to all parts of the city, which pick up that surplus of travel\\nwhich it has become impossible to accomplish above.\\n\\nThere are some thirty miles of tunneled railways in London, now, and the\\nwork of extending them is carried on with increasing energy. This railway\\nis double track everywhere, and forms two circuits, upon one of which the\\ntrains continually run in one direction, while those on the other track\\nrun in the opposite direction. Collisions are therefore impossible between\\nthese two systems of counter-currents. Numerous stations are built all\\nalong these roads, where travelers can descend to meet the trains or leave\\nthem, to make their ascend to the city above. To give the reader an idea\\nof the immense amount of traveling done in these dark passages under\\nLondon, it need only be stated that long trains of cars pass each station\\nevery \\\"ten minutes,\\\" and are as well filled with passengers as those of\\nrailroads on the surface of the earth. The cars are comfortably lighted,\\nso that after one has taken his seat and the train begins to run along, it\\nresembles night-traveling so perfectly, that the difference is scarcely\\nperceptible.\\n\\nOf all modes of travel, these underground railroads afford the quickest,\\ncheapest, safest and most convenient manner of transit.\\n\\nThis great metropolis includes the cities of London and Westminster, the\\nborough of Southwark, and thirty-six adjacent parishes, precincts,\\ntownships, &c. It covers an area of 122 square miles, and has a population\\nof about 4,000,000, that of the _City of London proper_ being no more than\\nabout 75,000. Murray's Modern London contains the following statistics:\\n\\n\\\"The Metropolis is supposed to consume in one year 1,600,000 quarters of\\nwheat, 300,000 bullocks, 1,700,000 sheep, 28,000 calves, and 35,000 pigs.\\\"\\n(If these animals were arranged in a double line, they would constitute a\\ndrove over a thousand miles long!)\\n\\n\\\"One market alone (Leadenhall) supplies about 4,025,000 head of game.\\nThis, together with 3,000,000 of salmon, irrespective of other fish and\\nflesh, is washed down by 43,200,000 gallons of porter and ale, 2,000,000\\ngallons of spirits, and 65,000 pipes of wine. To fill its milk and cream\\njugs, 13,000 cows are kept. To light it at night, 360,000 gas-lights\\nfringe the streets, consuming, every twenty-four hours, 13,000,000 cubic\\nfeet of gas; while the private consumption of gas in a year amounts to\\n10,000,000,000 cubic feet. Its arterial or water system supplies the\\nenormous quantity of 44,383,328 gallons per day, while its venous or sewer\\nsystem carries off 9,502,720 cubic feet of refuse. To warm its people and\\nto supply its factories, a fleet, amounting to upwards of a thousand sail,\\nis employed in bringing annually 3,000,000 tons of coal, exclusive of\\n2,000,000 tons brought by rail. The thirsty souls of London need have no\\nfear of becoming thirstier so long as there are upwards of 6,700 public\\nhouses and 2,000 wine merchants to minister to their deathless thirst.\\n\\n\\\"The bread to this enormous quantity of sack is represented by 2,500\\nbakers, 1,700 butchers, not including pork butchers, 2,600 tea dealers and\\ngrocers, 1,260 coffee-room keepers, nearly 1,500 dairy-men, and 1,350\\ntobacconists. To look after the digestion of this enormous amount of food\\nupwards of 2,400 duly licensed practitioners, surgeons and physicians are\\ndaily running to and fro through this mighty metropolis, whose patients,\\nin due course of time and physic, are handed over to the tender mercies of\\n500 undertakers. Nearly 3,000 boot and shoe-makers give their aid to keep\\nour feet dry and warm, while 2,950 tailors do as much for the rest of our\\nbodies. The wants of the fairer portion of the population are supplied, by\\n1,080 linen drapers, 1,500 milliners and dressmakers; 1,540 private\\nschools take charge of their children; and 290 pawn-brokers' shops find\\nemployment and profit out of the reverses, follies, and vices of the\\ncommunity. It is said that 700,000 _cats_ are kept in London, to maintain\\nwhom large part of the 3,000 horses which die every week is sold by\\ncat's-meat vendors. About 520,000 (1873) houses give shelter to upwards of\\nthree millions of people, whose little differences are aggravated or\\nsettled by upwards of 3,000 attorneys and 3,900 barristers.\\n\\n\\\"The spiritual wants of this mighty aggregate of human souls are cared for\\nby more than 2,000 clergymen and dissenting ministers, who respectively\\npreside over 620 churches and 423 chapels, of which latter buildings the\\nIndependents have 121, the Baptists 100, the Wesleyans 77, the Roman,\\nCatholics about 90, whereas in 1808 they had but 13, the Calvinists and,\\nEnglish Presbyterians 10 each, the Quakers 7, and the Jews 10; the\\nnumerous other sects being content with numbers varying from one to five\\neach. To wind up with the darkest part of the picture, the metropolis\\ncontains on an average 129,000 paupers.\\\"\\n\\nOn my way to London, I fell in company with a young gentleman who was well\\nacquainted in the metropolis, and who gave me much valuable information,\\nand assisted me in establishing myself in a central location, where\\nexcursions to all sections could be conveniently made. This was \\\"King's\\nCross Station,\\\" the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, and one of the\\nprincipal stations of the Metropolitan (or Underground) Railroad;\\nbesides, it is in the heart of the great city. We reached it by the\\nUnderground Railway from Paddington, the terminus of the Great Western\\nRailway. When we _came up out of the earth_ at Kings Cross, I saw a\\n_busy-ness_ such as I had never seen before. My friend went with me a\\nshort distance to point out a street where private rooms could be rented.\\n\\nThe tourist who wants to make the most of his time must never engage to\\nboard at his lodging-place, as it will be very inconvenient and at a\\nsacrifice of much time, to return thither for his meals. The most\\neconomical way is to have a room either at a hotel or at a private house,\\nand to take the meals at the numerous restaurants, one of which can be\\nreached anywhere in five minutes.\\n\\nI had great difficulty in procuring a room, but persisted in my inquiries\\nuntil I succeeded. The traveler will learn quicker than any other person\\nthat _perseverence is the only road to success_. He must often see\\neverything go contrary for a whole hour, and even sometimes for half a day\\nin succession. Such reverses frequently occasion a \\\"blue-Monday\\\" in the\\nmiddle of the week.\\n\\nMy first walk, after I had found a home in London, was to the Post-Office,\\nto look for letters from my friends in America, This was about three miles\\noff. I returned a different way, and took a look at the exterior of St.\\nPaul's. As the Covent Garden Theater (the finest in London) was already\\nfull before I reached it, I went on to the Oxford Street Music Theater and\\nspent my first evening there. The next day (Wednesday, July 14th,) I\\nentered\\n\\n\\n\\nSt. Paul's Cathedral,\\n\\n\\nthe noblest building in England in the Classic style. Its length from east\\nto west is 550 feet and its height to the top of the cross 370 feet. Under\\nthe dome is an area affording seats for 5,000 persons. Here 5,000 charity\\nchildren are collected on the first Thursday in June every year, to unite\\ntheir voices in songs of praise. Besides the dome, St. Paul's has two\\nother towers, each 222 feet high. In one of these is the clock and the\\ngreat bell upon which it strikes.\\n\\nThe length of the minute-hand of the clock is eight feet, and its weight\\nseventy-five pounds; the length of the hour-hand is five feet five inches,\\nand its weight forty-four pounds. The bell is ten feet in diameter and\\nweighs 11,474 pounds. \\\"It is inscribed, 'Richard Phelps made, me, 1716,'\\nand is never used except for striking the hour, and for tolling at the\\ndeaths and funerals of any of the Royal Family, the Bishops of London, the\\nDeans of St. Paul's, and the Lord Mayor, should he die in his mayoralty.\\\"\\n\\nIt requires a man three quarters of an hour every day to wind the clock,\\nthe striking weight alone weighing 1,200 pounds.\\n\\nThe dome constitutes a very remarkable whisper gallery, the slightest\\nwhisper being transmitted from one side to the other with the greatest\\ndistinctness.\\n\\nThis Cathedral contains many fine monuments interesting from the persons\\nthey commemorate. Among them are those to the Duke of Wellington, to\\nNelson, to Lord Cornwallis, to Sir Charles Napier, to Sir William Jones,\\nthe Oriental scholar, and numerous others.\\n\\n\\n\\nCrystal Palace,\\n\\n\\nwhich is outside of the city, is perhaps the grandest Exposition Building\\nin the world, and possibly the only structure of the kind in existence,\\nsince the destruction, by fire, of Crystal Palace, in New York. This Great\\nExhibition Building was first built upon Hyde Park, covering nearly\\nnineteen acres of ground. It was visited by upwards of 6,000,000 persons\\nduring the twenty-four weeks that it was open, or about 40,000 persons\\ndaily. The receipts amounted to over $2,000,000.\\n\\nIt was re-erected and enlarged at Sydenham, in Kent, 1853-4, at a cost of\\nover $7,000,000.\\n\\nIt must be over a quarter of a mile long, and about one-fourth as wide.\\nThe entire sides and the whole of the immense arched roof are of glass,\\nadmitting all the light except what little is intercepted by the sashes,\\nthus affording an illumination quite equal to that outside, under the\\nclear canopy of heaven.\\n\\nThe exterior gardens and water-works are magnificent. Among the\\nattractions about the yard, is a glass tower about forty-five or fifty\\nfeet in diameter and over 200 feet high. Beautiful indeed is this\\nmagnificent crystal tower.\\n\\nA clock with sixty-nine faces shows the times of so many different places\\non our planet. For the accommodation of such as are astronomically\\ninclined, I render the following record as I entered it upon my diary,\\nJuly 16th: Civil Middle Time, 12:40 p.m.; Astronomical Middle Time, 12:39\\u00bd\\np.m.; Sidereal Time, 19:49\\u00be; True Time, 12:38\\u00bd p.m.\\n\\nAround its great organ, there is seating accommodation for a choir of\\n2,000 singers.\\n\\nFor seeing the building only, one could well afford to go a great\\ndistance; but there are also constantly on exhibition a large collection\\nof curiosities of every description, while extensive bazars expose for\\nsale the richest and finest goods and wares of all kinds, and from the\\nstores of every quarter of the globe.\\n\\nThere is also on exposition a large collection of plants, and a\\nmagnificent art gallery of paintings, sculpture, &c. Concert every day.\\n\\nLondon has much fog and rain. I had but two fair days out of the eight I\\nspent there. One very rainy morning I started out to see the Houses of\\nParliament. On my way thither I came to Trafalgar Square. In the center\\nstands the magnificent Nelson Column, surrounded by statues and\\nfountains. In order to-shield myself from the rain, and to enjoy the view\\nof the grand square before me, and of the Parliamentary Buildings in the\\ndistance, I took refuge upon the portico of the National Gallery of\\nPaintings. Here I incidentally met and formed the acquaintance of the\\nbrother of Miss Rosie Hersee, a songstress, who had lately made herself\\npopular in this country. After accompanying me through the Art Gallery, he\\nchanged his programme for the afternoon, and had the kindness to spent the\\nbalance of the day with me, showing me through the Houses of Parliament\\nand Westminster Abbey. The tourist should constantly be on the lookout for\\nsome suitable companion who is well posted at the place that he proposes\\nto visit. Without such a person to point out things and explain them, one\\nwill miss more than he sees. I had just taken leave of a gentleman who had\\ngiven me considerable assistance, but whose course so differed from my\\nprogramme, that I was in fear of losing time should I accompany him\\nlonger. My new companion was a short-hand reporter of one of the London\\npapers, and thoroughly acquainted in Westminster.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Houses of Parliament.\\n\\n\\nThis is one of the largest buildings ever erected continuously in\\nEurope--perhaps the largest Gothic edifice in the world. It stands upon\\nthe bank of the Thames, occupying the site of the old Royal Palace of\\nWestminster, burnt down in 1834, and covers nearly eight acres. This\\nbuilding has 100 staircases, more than two miles of corridors, and 1,100\\napartments! The cost of erection was some $14,000,000, or a little more\\nthan that of the Capitol of the United States.\\n\\nHaving procured tickets we entered by the Royal Entrance under the\\nVictoria Tower, one of the most stupendous structures of the kind in the\\nworld. It is 340 feet high and seventy-five feet square. The entrance\\narchway is sixty-five feet high, and the vault is a rich and beautiful\\ngrained roof of elaborate workmanship, while the interior is decorated\\nwith statues of her present Majesty, supported by Justice and Mercy, and\\nthe statues of the patron saints of England, Scotland and Ireland.\\n\\nThe first apartment that we entered, was the Robing Room. From this room,\\nafter the ceremony of robing, her Majesty on her way to the Throne passes\\nthrough a magnificent hall 110 feet long, forty-five feet wide and\\nforty-five feet high, called the Victoria Gallery. It contains two\\nmagnificent frescoes of events in the history of England, covering large\\nsections of the two side-walls. One represents the death of Nelson, and\\nthe other the meeting of Wellington and Bl\\u00fccher after the Battle of\\nWaterloo.\\n\\n_The House of Peers_, ninety-seven feet long, forty-five feet wide, and\\nforty-five high, is one of the richest and most magnificent chambers in\\nthe world. To the left of the entrance is the Throne on which her Majesty\\nsits when she attends the House, and beside it, the chair of the Prince of\\nWales. Rich in carvings and lavishly gilt, this noble chamber presents a\\nview of great grandeur.\\n\\nThe subdued light, admitted by the stained glass of its windows, does not\\ndazzle the eye as would a perfect illumination of such giltings, but what\\nis lost in _splendor_, is perhaps gained in _modest grandeur_.\\n\\n\\\"The arrival of her Majesty is announced within the House by the booming\\nof the cannon. Her entrance is preceeded by the Heralds in their rich\\ndress, and by some of the chief officers of state in their robes. All the\\npeers are in their robes. The Speech is presented to her Majesty by the\\nLord Chancellor, kneeling, and is read by her Majesty or by him; the Royal\\nPrinces and Princesses with the Mistress of the Robes and one of the\\nladies of the bed-chamber standing by her side on the dais. The return to\\nBuckingham Palace is by three at the latest.\\\"\\n\\nThe old custom of examining the cellars underneath the House of Lords,\\nsome hours before her Majesty's arrival, is still observed. This custom\\nhad its origin in the infamous Gunpowder plot of 1605.\\n\\n_The House of Commons_ is sixty-two feet long by forty-five feet broad and\\nforty-five feet high; to which England and Wales return 500 members,\\nIreland 105, and Scotland 53, making in all 658 members.\\n\\nSt. Stephens Hall 95 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 56 feet high to the apex\\nof the stone groining, is lined by twelve \\\"statues of Parliamentary\\nstatesmen who rose to eminence by the eloquence and abilities they\\ndisplayed in the House of Commons,\\\" Fox and Pitt are here placed on\\nopposite sides of the hall, \\\"facing\\\" each other after the manner they were\\nwont to in the House of Commons.\\n\\nWestminster Hall is 290 feet in length, 68 feet in width, and 110 feet in\\nheight. \\\"It is the largest apartment not supported by pillars in the\\nworld.\\\" Let the reader picture to himself the scenes of the events which\\nhistory records as having taken place in this venerable Hall. \\\"Here were\\nhung the banners taken from Charles I., at the battle of Naseby; from\\nCharles II. at the battle of Worcester; at Preston and Dunbar; and,\\nsomewhat later, those taken at the battle of Blenheim. Here, at the upper\\nend of the Hall, Oliver Cromwell was inaugurated as Lord Protector,\\nsitting in a robe of purple velvet lined with ermine, on a rich cloth of\\nstate, with the gold sceptre in one hand, the Bible richly gilt and bossed\\nin the other, and his sword at his side. Here, four years later, at the\\ntop of the Hall fronting Palace-yard, his head was set on a pole, with the\\nskulls of Ireton on one side, of Bradshaw on the other. Here, shameless\\nruffians sought employment as hired witnesses, and walked openly in the\\nHall with a straw in the shoe to denote their quality; and here the good,\\nthe great, the brave, the wise, and the abandoned have been brought to\\ntrial. Here (in the Hall of Rufus) Sir William Wallace was tried and\\ncondemned; in this very Hall, Sir Thomas More and Protector Sommerset were\\ndoomed to the scaffold. Here, in Henry VIII.'s reign (1517), entered the\\nCity apprentices, implicated in the murders on 'Evil May Day' of the\\naliens settled in London, each with a halter round his neck, and crying\\n'Mercy, gracious Lord, Mercy,' while Wolsey stood by, and the King,\\nbeneath his cloth of state, heard their defense and pronounced their\\npardon--the prisoners shouting with delight and casting up their halters\\nto the Hall roof, 'so that the King,' as the chroniclers observe, 'might\\nperceive they were none of the descreetest.' Here the notorious Earl and\\nCountess of Somerset were tried in the reign of James I. for the murder of\\nSir Thomas Overbury. Here, the great Earl of Stafford was condemned; the\\nKing being present, and the Commons sitting bareheaded all the time. The\\n_High Court of Justice_ which condemned King Charles I. sat in this Hall,\\nthe upper part hung with scarlet cloth, and the King sitting underneath,\\nwith the Naseby banners suspended above his head. Lilly, the astrologer,\\nwho was present, saw the silver top fall from the King's staff, and others\\nheard Lady Fairfax exclaim, when her husband's name was called over, 'He\\nhas more wit than to be here.' Here, in the reign of James II., the seven\\nbishops were acquitted. Here Dr. Sacheverel was tried and pronounced\\nguilty by a majority of seventeen. Here the rebel Lords of 1745,\\nKilmarnock, Balmerino, and Lovat, were heard and condemned. Here, Warren\\nHastings was tried, and Burke and Sheridan grew eloquent and impassioned,\\nwhile Senators by birth and election, and the beauty and rank of Great\\nBritain, sat earnest spectators and listeners of the extraordinary scene.\\nThe last public trial in the Hall was Lord Melville's in 1806; and the\\nlast coronation dinner in the Hall was that of George IV., when, according\\nto the custom maintained for ages, and for the last time probably, the\\nKing's champion (Dymocke) rode into the Hall in full armor, and threw down\\nthe gauntlet, challenging the world in a King's behalf. Silver plates were\\nlaid, on the same occasion, for 334 guests,\\\"--_Murray_.\\n\\nThe _Central_ or _Octagon Hall_ is an elegant and well lighted apartment\\neighty feet in height. It is covered by a groined roof ornamented with 250\\nbosses.\\n\\nThe _Clock Tower_ is forty feet square and 320 feet high. The Palace Clock\\nin this tower is an eighty-day clock, striking the hours and chiming the\\nquarters upon eight bells. Its four dials on the tower are each thirty\\nfeet in diameter.\\n\\nFrom the Houses of Parliament we went over to see Westminster Abbey,\\nwhich is on the opposite side of the street. The contrast between those\\nbuildings is so striking, that old Westminster seemed to be quite an\\nordinary edifice. As I looked at its weather-beaten and moss-covered\\nwalls, and its small proportions as compared with the grand edifice which\\nwe had just left; I speculated what the old stable-like building might\\nlook like on the inside. We had not entered long before I observed that it\\nwas somewhat larger than I had imagined. It is 416 feet long, 203 feet\\nacross the transepts, and 101 feet 8 inches to the roof.\\n\\nBack of the high altar is Edward the Confessor's Chapel containing the\\ngraves and monuments of nine kings and queens. In this chapel are the two\\n_Coronation Chairs_ upon which all the sovereigns of Great Britain have\\nbeen crowned since the death of Henry III., (by whom Westminster Abbey was\\nbuilt), beginning with the coronation of his son? Edward I., and Queen\\nEleanor, October 19th, 1274. One of these chairs has for a seat the\\nvenerable stone on which the Scottish kings had been crowned at Scone from\\ntime immemorial; but which together with the regalia of Scotland, Edward\\nI. brought with him as trophies in 1296. \\\"This stone is 26 inches long, 16\\ninches wide, and 11 inches thick.\\\"\\n\\nIn the \\\"Poet's Corner\\\" we joined a party and were guided through the\\nchapels.\\n\\nIn Henry VII.'s Chapel we found a very beautiful effigy of the Princess\\nSophia lying in an alabaster cradle. This infant princess was the daughter\\nof James I., and is not mentioned by some historians, having died at a\\nvery tender age.\\n\\nThis chapel contains many royal tombs. Among others are the altar-tomb,\\nwith effigy of the mother of Lord Darnley, husband of Mary, Queen of\\nScots; tomb, with effigy of Queen Elizabeth (her sister, Mary, being\\nburied in the same grave); and the tomb, with a fine effigy of Mary, Queen\\nof Scots, erected by her son, King James IV., of Scotland, (being James I.\\nof England). The face of this image is very beautiful, and generally\\nrecognized as a genuine likeness of the Queen. Oliver Cromwell's bones\\nwere speedily ejected from this chapel at the Restoration.\\n\\nIn the E. aisle of the North Transept is a remarkable monument to Mr. and\\nMrs. Nightingale. Death represented in the ghastly form of a sheeted\\nskeleton has just issued from a dark aperture in the lower part of the\\nmonument, and aims his dart at the sick lady who has sunk affrighted into\\nher husband's arms. \\\"This dying woman,\\\" says Cunningham, \\\"would do honor\\nto any artist.\\\"\\n\\nIn another part of the church, we found a fine monument to \\\"Major John\\nAndre, who raised by his merit, at an early period of life, to the rank of\\nAdj. General of the British forces in America, and employed in an\\nimportant but hazardous enterprise, fell a sacrifice to his zeal and his\\nking and country on the 2nd of October, A.D., 1780, aged 29 years,\\nuniversally beloved and esteemed. His gracious sovereign, King George the\\nThird, has caused this monument to be erected. The remains of Major John\\nAndre were on the 10th of August, 1821, removed from Tappan by James\\nBuchanan, Esq., his Majesty's consul at New York, under instruction from\\nhis Royal Highness, the Duke of York, and with the permission of Dean and\\nChapter finally deposited in a grave contiguous to this monument on the\\n28th of November, 1821.\\\"\\n\\nThere are altogether between twenty-five and thirty kings and queens\\nburied in this Abbey, besides a host of England's most famous statesmen,\\nsoldiers, poets and other eminent persons that have flourished within the\\nlast five or six centuries, a mere catalogue of whose names would fill\\nwhole pages.\\n\\nIt seems odd enough to an American to find large graveyards in the\\ninterior of churches and cathedrals, and to see monuments, tombs and\\naltar-tombs, with the effigies of persons lying in state having all kinds\\nof animals (their crests) lying at their feet; but a day in Westminster\\nwill accustom one to such scenes.\\n\\n\\n\\nArms and Crests.\\n\\n\\nIn England, it is very common to place the crests of the nobility with\\ntheir effigies upon their tombs. Thus Mary, Queen of Scots, has the lion\\nlying at her feet, and in St. Mary's, at Warwick, I learned that the\\nMuzzled Bear is the Earl of Warwick's crest, while the Marquis of\\nNorthampton has the Black Swan, and Richard Beauchamp the Bear and\\nGriffin. Even literary characters were not without them, Shakespeare for\\nexample, had adopted the Falcon rising argent, supporting a spear, in\\npale.\\n\\n\\n\\nSunday in London.\\n\\n\\nOn Sunday morning, July 18th, I started out at random to find a church\\nwhere religious service was held. Before going far I came to a large\\nchurch edifice (St. Pancras) where numbers of people were assembling from\\nall directions and gradually filling up that capacious building which has\\nseats for about 3,000 worshipers. Upon the portico I met the\\nSuperintendent of the Mission House, who had accompanied the Vicar of St.\\nPancras on a visit to Canada, some years ago, and who seemed as much\\npleased to meet an American as I was benefited by his kind attentions and\\naccommodations. For three-fourths of an hour, he answered me questions and\\nexplained the organization of the Church of England, which by the way, is\\nquite as complicated as the organization of the civil government of a\\nnation. Arch-bishops, bishops, vicars, canons, deans, chapters, curates,\\n&c., constitute a list of ecclesiastical dignitaries whose functions are\\nnot very easily defined and comprehended by a stranger. Just before\\nservice commenced, he conducted me to a seat near the pulpit. Rev.\\nThorold, the officiating clergyman, is a very able speaker, and made the\\nfirst attempt at argument in his discourse that I had yet listened to in\\nEngland. Preaching, in England, like the reciting of prayers, is all so\\nmuch blank assertion--no more, and no less. I had never before so felt the\\nforce of _unquestioned authority_ as I learned to feel and appreciate it\\nin the services of the Episcopal Church of England. The very fact of\\narguing a question is in itself a compromise of its one-sidedness and of\\nthe infallibility of the position the preacher may have taken; but let the\\nclergy of an entire nation read the same mass and recite the same prayers\\nin all their congregations, and let them refrain from discussing\\nscriptural texts, and all give one and the same answer to each and every\\nquestion, and there will soon be an end of sectarianism. The best\\nreasoning has always provoked more doubt than it has established faith,\\nand in consequence, ever been more fruitful of contention than of peace.\\nSo long as a people are one-minded they will be peaceful and contended\\neven if they are bound in wretched slavery, but the tide of revolution has\\nset in at London, and the church begins to tremble, and the clergy to\\nargue. In the afternoon, the weather being very fair, I went to\\n\\n\\n\\nHyde Park.\\n\\n\\nThis park has an area of 388 acres, upon which may be seen all the wealth\\nand fashion and splendid equipages of the nobility and gentry of England.\\nA meeting of the Radicals had been announced and placarded over the city,\\ninviting all workingmen to be present and enter their protest against\\nParliament appropriating any money to the Prince of Wales for defraying\\nthe expenses of his contemplated trip to India. The novelty of seeing a\\npolitical meeting on _Sunday_, and that too on the part of the Republicans\\nin monarchial England, was enough to entice me thither, so I went early\\nand spent an hour with a silver-haired clergyman, upon a settee under the\\nshade of a tree not far from \\\"The Reform Tree,\\\" around which, as this\\ngentleman informed me, the nucleus of Radical meetings is always formed.\\nOn my way to the park, I was accompanied for some distance by a certain\\npoliceman, (whose acquaintance I had formed during the week); to him I\\nexpressed my surprise at seeing Great Britain compromise the sacredness of\\nthe Sabbath with radical Republicanism and Rationalism! \\\"Well,\\\" said he,\\n\\\"If we let them have their own way, they will come here and hold their\\nmeetings and after they have listened to their leaders awhile and cheered\\nright lustily, they will scatter and that is the end of it, but when we\\ninterfere, there is no telling where the matter will end. In 1866, we once\\nclosed the park against them, and the consequence was a riot in which the\\npolice suffered severely from brick-bats, and the mob finally took hold of\\nthe iron fence and tore it away for a long distance along the park, made\\ntheir entry, and took their own way.\\\" \\\"Well could you not have punished\\nthose offenders according to due process of law?\\\" I asked. \\\"Yes,\\\" he\\nrejoined, \\\"we might, but their number was so great that we could never\\nhave finished trying them all!\\\" Thus it often happens that what is\\ncriminal for one or several to do, goes unpunished when a thousand offend,\\nand besides they open the way to new privileges and greater liberties.\\n\\nAt 3:00 o'clock a mighty flood of the Reform Party, headed by Bradlaugh\\nand Watts, marched into the park and, soon a large meeting of many\\nthousands was formed, which increased in numbers as long as the speakers\\ncontinued to address them. It is a striking feature of these reform\\nagitations, perhaps of every revolutionary movement that has ever been\\nundertaken and accomplished, that they are headed and lead by men whose\\npersonal influence embodies the whole power of the organizations, and\\nwhose word and command are their supreme law. This meeting was variously\\nestimated at between 20,000 and 50,000 persons, and this immense concourse\\nof people was us perfectly under the control of Chas. Bradlaugh as the\\nbest organized army can be under its general. This harmony must be\\nattributed to the fact that the movement is a spontaneous one in which\\neach member participates because he likes the leader and his principles.\\nIt is an encouraging feature of these reformers that they do not despise\\n_everything_ that the past has handed down to our time, as the\\nhot-blooded Communists of Paris seemed to be inclined to do in the late\\n_crisis_. The dress of these agitators speak nothing about bloody\\nrevolution as did the \\\"red cap\\\" and slouch hat of the political reformers\\nof Europe of earlier times.\\n\\nBradlaugh, for an example, wears a black dress coat, silk dress hat,\\nlay-down collar and black necktie, and carries a cane. The great majority\\nof the meeting wore also the fashionable \\\"stove-pipe.\\\" These things and\\nthe sound judgment of the leaders promise \\\"peaceable reforms\\\" but the\\nboundless enthusiasm of the mass of them when imflammatory remarks are\\nmade, betray the existence of feelings that are akin to pent up volcanoes,\\nand may break out in violent eruptions when least expected. There is\\ncertainly fire enough in European Republicanism to impel them on to mighty\\nefforts when the proper time comes. The part played by several ladies in\\nthis movement has a salutary influence for moderation and order. Mrs.\\nBesant and the two daughters of Mr. Bradlaugh are always accompanying him\\nwherever he lectures in London. A table was placed in the center of a\\ncircle formed around the leaders, and upon this Mr. Bradlaugh took his\\nstand in addressing the meeting. His voice is far more powerful than that\\nof any other man that I have ever heard, and by the use of medicine which\\nhis elder daughter (Alice) reaches up to him very frequently during his\\nspeeches, he keeps it perfectly clear to the end; though in these open\\nair meetings he often, stands in the face of 10,000 to 100,000 persons,\\nspeaking by the hour with a force quite equal to the roaring of a lion.\\nThis violent exercise of his vooal organs, he sometimes repeats several\\ntimes every day for a month in succession, displaying powers of endurance\\nwhich are perhaps not equaled by any other living orator. It is an\\nexciting scene to behold acres of hats beclouding the sky while \\\"cheers\\nrend the air,\\\" and to see a field white with hands when votes are taken.\\nOnly three persons in this entire meeting voted in favor of granting the\\nPrince of Wales the $700,000 asked for, while some acres of people voted\\nagainst it.\\n\\nIt should be remembered that this was a meeting of the _extreme_ branch of\\nthe Republican party in London. There is a more moderate party headed by\\nleaders who only despise royalty, but abide with the Church and the\\nChristian religion, and which is said to be far more numerous than the\\nextremists are. In the evening the Radicals had a meeting in the Hall of\\nScience, where Mr. Bradlaugh addressed them on the subject of religion and\\nsocial ethics. His discourses here are generally very abtruse. None but a\\nvery intelligent audience, and educated in his system of philosophy would\\nunderstand his logic or appreciate his wit and humor at the expense of\\nroyalty and Christianity. The hall will hold about 1,500 adults and his\\ncongregation (?) is a mixed one comprising both sexes, just like all\\nchurch organizations; after which, it is a copy. There is no praying, but\\nthe Miss Brad laughs render music upon a melodian or organ both before and\\nafter the lecture. In place of the \\\"collection,\\\" they charge a small\\nadmittance, which becomes a source of considerable revenue; as the hall is\\ncrowded at almost every meeting. I must here record, one more feature\\nwhich implies, besides the oratorical powers and progressive originality\\nof the father, an intensity of interest on the part of a daughter, in her\\nfather's views, such as is seldom witnessed. Miss Alice B. will, from the\\nbeginning to the end of every lecture, keep the eye of her father,\\nwatching every change of his countenance from the flush of a glowing\\nenthusiasm to the pallor of bitter contempt, catching every syllable he\\nutters, reflecting with beaming smiles every happy hit he makes, and\\nsinking down to the paleness of utter disdain with him, when he comes to\\nthe recital of the heartless oppressions of the aristocracy; continually\\nfollowing his remarks with such an interest as if she was seeing and\\nhearing him for the first time in her life.\\n\\nI have given a somewhat lengthy account of these Radical meetings and\\nrationalistic sentiments, not on account of their popularity in England,\\nfor though hundreds of thousands endorse the movement in London and a\\nnumber of other cities in Great Britain, still they are by far in the\\nminority, at least when the question of religion is taken; but upon the\\ncontinent of Europe--in France, Germany, and I had almost added\\nSwitzerland and Italy, the case is already different or fast becoming so.\\nRationalism is rampant, and the reader should constantly bear in mind, as\\nI may not often return to this topic, that the majority of the intelligent\\npeople in most places are of the camp that I have described as holding\\nthese meetings on Hyde Park and in the Hall of Science in London.\\n\\nThose Radical societies have their own hymn-books, and even their children\\nare baptised and the dead buried, according to their own forms and\\nceremonies, of unbelief.\\n\\nOf the numerous other parks in London, I have no room to make mention. Of\\nthe British Museum, comprising a collection of books, works of art,\\nantiquities, and curiosities, larger than that of any other museum\\ncontained under one roof in the world, costing in the aggregate\\n$12,000,000, and the building $5,000,000, and of the South Kensington\\nMuseum fast approaching the British Museum in the vastness of its\\ncollection, I can only add, that a complete catalogue of their collections\\nwould fill several large volumes, and to examine all their contents would\\nrequire many weeks. There are numerous other museums and galleries of art\\nstrewn over the great metropolis, each more comprehensive than the pride\\nand boast of many other cities of pretention in the world, but in London\\nthey are only regarded as second rate collections.\\n\\nIf a tourist has only a few days to devote to London, he should not fail\\nto pass through Park Lane (along Hyde Park, at the foot of which lives the\\nson of Arthur, the Duke of Wellington, Commander at Waterloo) thence along\\nPiccadilly, passing Charing Cross, Trafalgar Square, the Strand and Fleet\\nStreet, and, having visited Westminster Abbey and St. Paul's Cathedral,\\nwill now find\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Tower of London.\\n\\n\\nnext in importance. This ancient citadel is the most celebrated in\\nEngland, and dates back to the time of William the Conqueror (A.D., 1066)\\nat least; but tradition refers it even to Caesar's time. It covers over\\ntwelve acres, and its walls are about three-fifth of a mile in circuit.\\nThe outer walls of the White Tower, which stands within the\\nfortifications, are fifteen feet thick.\\n\\n\\\"This Tower\\\" (The Tower of London) \\\"is a citadel to defend or command the\\ncity; a royal palace; a prison of state for the most dangerous offenders;\\nthe armory for warlike provisions; the treasury of the ornaments and\\njewels of the Crown; and general conserver of most of the records of the\\nKing's courts of justice at Westminster.\\\"--_Stow_.\\n\\nThe Bloody Tower, so called because within it was committed the murder of\\nthe princes, Edward V. and Duke of York, sons of Edward IV., by order of\\nRichard III. In this Tower is the Jewel-house containing the regalia and\\nthe Crown jewels. Among these, are St. Edward's Crown which was made for\\nthe coronation of Charles II., (A.D., 1649), and used in the coronations\\nof all the sovereigns since his time. The Crown made for the coronation of\\nVictoria, consisting of a purple velvet cap enclosed by hoops of silver,\\nand studded with diamonds. It weighs 1\\u00be pounds. This Crown is estimated at\\n\\u00a3111,900 (about $550,000). The Crown of the Prince of Wales, of pure gold,\\nunadorned by jewels. The Queen Consort's Crown, of gold adorned with\\nprecious stones. The Queen's Diadem. Besides, staffs, sceptres, spurs, the\\nAmpulla of the Holy Oil, the Coronation Spoon, the Golden Salt-cellar of\\nState, in the shape of a castle, Baptismal Font, used at the Christening\\nof the Royal Children, a Silver Wine Fountain, maces, swords, bracelets\\n&c.,--all arranged upon a large table, enclosed by a glass case and\\nshielded by iron palings. These treasures are estimated at $17,000,000!\\n\\nThe Horse Armory is contained in a hall 150 feet long and 33 feet wide. In\\nthe center, is a line of equestrian figures, 22 in number, clothed in the\\narmor of the various reigns from the time of Edward I. to James II.\\n(1272-1688). When armory had reached its height, just before the\\nintroduction of gunpowder, the suits of armor were so heavy and covered\\nthe bodies of the soldiers and horses so completely, that a knight in\\nfull armor looked much like a turtle sitting upon an armadillo. I saw a\\nsuit of armor that weighs 112 pounds, and a spear 18 feet in length. In\\nthose days physical strength carried almost everything, while intelligence\\nfrequently counted nothing. Looking at those mailed figures makes one\\nalmost feel ashamed of his ancestry. Besides one of the blocks upor which\\nwere beheaded both the innocent and the guilty in former times, there are\\nalso on exhibition the Collar of Torture, 14 pounds in weight, the\\nThumb-screw, the Stocks, &c., a collection of instruments of torture well\\ncalculated to restore in the mind of the beholder, a vivid picture of the\\ndark and wretched past, when man's greatest and most dangerous enemy was\\nhis brother. It seemed then to be the best policy of kings, queens, and of\\nall noblemen, to get rid of brothers and sisters at the earliest\\nconvenience!\\n\\nOn our way to Beauchamp Tower, the Prison of Anne Boleyn and Lady Jane\\nGrey, we passed Tower Green, where Anne Boleyn, Lady Jane Grey and\\nCatherine Howard, three queens, were beheaded.\\n\\nThis is the place where King Henry VIII. had several of his six wives\\ndispatched, which he could not well have got rid of, by divorce.\\n\\nI had intended to touch in these remarks a number of other points about\\nLondon, and especially the almost boundless resources of England's welthy\\nLords, but I can only present a single example, and must then hurry on\\nwith my account to Continental Europe. The wealthiest nobleman whose home\\nand dwelling-place I passed, is the Duke of Maclew (a Scotchman) whose\\nannual income is estimated at \\u00a3350,000 or about $1,700,000. He lives at\\nWhite Hall, near Westminster Bridge.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VII.\\n\\nLondon to Paris.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Wednesday, July 21st, the eight day of my stay in London, I went to\\nCharing Cross Station and procured a ticket for Paris. Before leaving\\nhowever, I exchanged my English currency for French money. The rate of\\nExchange is 25 francs for one sovereign. The exchange clerk explained to\\nme the relative values of the French coins which I found to be much easier\\nto understand than English money.\\n\\nThe table runs thus: 100 centimes equal one franc; and 20 francs, one\\nnapoleon. The coins are: napoleons, (20\\u00a3), 10 franc and 5 franc pieces in\\ngold; francs and half-franc coins in silver; and 10 centime, 5 centime,\\n(the sou), and 1 centime copper and nickle coins, though the centime is\\nnot in general circulation now, being equal to but one fifth of a cent in\\nour money. It was a great consolation to me to know that I would\\nunderstand the French money perfectly, especially as I expected not to be\\nable to speak with anybody in Paris, except, now and then, with a stray\\nGerman or Englishman. Soon after entering the train at Charing Cross I met\\na Frenchman (Prof. P. Simond who could speak English fluently, having\\noccupied his time in England in teaching French, and was on his way to\\nParis to spend his vacation there. He offered at once, very kindly, to\\nassist me in Paris, and I felt from that moment that I should be ten-fold\\nluckier in making my entry into Paris than I had thus far had reason to\\nexpect. The train left London at 6:35 p.m., and was to make connection\\nwith a steamer for Calais, (pron. K[)a]l'[)i]), thence by rail to Paris,\\nreaching the latter place the next afternoon. The \\\"through ticket\\\" 3rd\\nClass, from London to Paris, cost 21 shillings. Distance 262 miles.\\n\\nSoon after leaving London, I discovered that I was surrounded by the\\nfamily of an English merchant, who, having retired from business, had\\ntaken his wife and daughters to make a trip to the Continent, with a view\\nto see France and Germany. The mother expressed great delight on learning\\nthat I was an American, remarking that \\\"Americans are not so _stiff_ in\\ntheir intercourse.\\\" It was lot long before I felt that I was in a fair\\nposition to spend the _day and night en route from London to Paris_\\npleasantly, even if we were to be confined to the cars and the boat with\\nthe exception of a few hours.\\n\\nWe crossed the Strait of Dover at about midnight, though not _unawares_!\\n\\nAs I had no fears of getting sea-sick upon the Strait of Dover, I took my\\nseat on the deck in confidence of a pleasant voyage. Mrs. L. soon asked me\\nwhether I did not expect to get sick, stating that she was in great fear\\nof it. I replied that I hoped our passage was too short for getting sick,\\nas the waves were not apt to rise very high in such a narrow strait. But I\\nwas mistaken; the sick were soon moaning in every direction. My gay\\ncompanions all disappeared except the old gentleman and his younger\\ndaughter. A large steamship of 3,000 tons burden would probably show more\\ndignity, but the little steamer upon which we had taken passage, was as\\nfiercely knocked about by the waves, and made fully as much ado about it,\\nas the old \\\"Manhattan\\\" ever did in the middle of the Atlantic. The young\\nlady was keeping close to her father and had already ceased to laugh, when\\nI asked him the last time about their health. _He_ was well, but the young\\nlady was also becoming dizzy from the rocking, and turning pale at the\\nterrors of the sea. I hastened to the cabin below and sought relief in\\nlying down. Being both weary and giddy I soon fell into a sleep, from\\nwhich I did not wake until we reached Calais.\\n\\nThe train for Paris was not to leave until the next morning, so I tried to\\nfind rest and sleep in the Waiting Room, but without success. By and by a\\ngentleman came round and offered to conduct us to lodging places. I\\nfollowed him into the city, through strange streets into a strange house,\\nand was shown to retire in a strange room. Everything seemed in its place,\\nhowever, so that I had no occasion for feeling uneasy. The next morning I\\nrose at break of day and took a long walk through the city of Calais, to\\nlook about and see as much, as possible before I had to leave. This was my\\nfirst walk on the Continent of Europe.\\n\\nI looked about where I might get breakfast, but as most of the business\\nhouses were not yet open, I stood a poor chance. Into the saloons I would\\nnot go, as I could not have asked for what I wanted on account of my\\ninability to speak French; my only hope, therefore, was to find a shop or\\nstore that displayed in the window what I wanted, so that I could make my\\npurchase by gestures. I had provided myself with a Conversational Guide\\nBook, in London, containing the French, Italian and German equivalents of\\nEnglish words and phrases, most necessary to the tourist; but the French\\npronunciation is so difficult that I could after all not make myself\\nunderstood except by pointing out these French words to the shop-keepers.\\nTo give the reader an idea of what mistakes an American is apt to make in\\npronouncing French, I offer the names of two of the most common articles\\nof food. They are _pain_ (bread) pronounced p\\u00e4, and _lait_ (milk)\\npronounced l[=a]. I succeeded, however, later in the morning, when the\\nshops were generally open, to procure a breakfast, whereupon, after having\\nvisited a very antique church and examined the strong fortifications of\\nthe city, I started for the railway station.\\n\\nOn my way thither I passed the open door of a saloon in which Mr. and\\nMrs. L., whose friendship I had formed the previous day, sat at coffee. It\\nwas a pleasant surprise, and I took my seat with them, drinking coffee for\\nthe benefit of the milk (_du lait_) which I poured into it. This done, Mr.\\nL. invited me to accompany him to their hotel to \\\"see what a nice place\\nthey had found last night!\\\" It was a excellant hotel, and as we approached\\nthe beautiful flower-beds which lined the path leading to the entrance,\\ntheir daughter came down the walk, and greeted us, the old gentleman\\nremarking that they had been inquiring last night what had become of me.\\nIt is very pleasant and agreeable to fall into such society, and to behold\\nthe cloth spread and the China and glass ware set with an excellent\\nbreakfast (a regular home-fashion scene) after one has spent several hours\\nin lingual conflicts for a breakfast, and seen nothing but the outside of\\nold weather-beaten houses.\\n\\nI took my seat with the English party and my French friend (Prof. P.S.) in\\nthe same car, and left Calais at 7:20 a.m. Everything looked strange\\nagain; even more so than when I first came to England. Everybody, except\\nour English company, spoke French, and the cars, the buildings, and the\\ntickets and conductors, seemed all different from what I was accustomed to\\nin England. The houses which we saw from the train, were small and covered\\nwith tiles like those which I had seen in northwestern England. We soon\\npassed burial grounds in which the graves were headed with crosses, in\\nplace of marble slabs, for tombstones. Large quantities of peat and the\\nwhite stone quarries in the chalk formations, next arrested our attention.\\nThough it was the 22nd of July, haying was not yet finished. Some of the\\nfarmers were, however, engaged in reaping both their wheat and barley. At\\n8:34 a.m., the English Channel came again into view. Thus we passed along\\nenjoying the scenery of \\\"belle France,\\\" (beautiful France), but by and by\\nwe became tired of watching landscapes.\\n\\nTo see odd styles of architecture, and watch the strange ways about a\\npeople, may afford a pleasant diversion for a time; but the eyes, too,\\nbecome tired of looking. A striking feature about the agriculture is the\\nsmallness of many of the fields; there being no fences, the fields are\\ndistinguished by their crops. Some of them are but several rods in extent.\\nThe various colors which the different kinds of vegetables assume in their\\nprogress of growth and ripening, make the landscape look like an immense\\nexpanse of checkered carpet, exceedingly beautiful to behold.\\n\\nWhen these scenes seemed no longer to be charming, or we had become too\\nfatigued to appreciate them, we commenced to amuse ourselves in games,\\njoking and tricks, of which the traveler sees and enjoys his fill.\\n\\nGambling; which is such a wide-spread social evil in America, is\\nprohibited or restricted to certain fixed days of the year, in some\\ncountries of Europe; but games of various kinds are played, by the best\\nsociety, almost everywhere. Notwithstanding all the arguments that may be\\nadvanced in favor of games at chess and back-gammon, as exercises in\\nmental gymnastics, and of playing cards as affording pleasant diversion\\nfor mixed parties, the diligent tourist, like the industrious student,\\nshould not squander much of his time at it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VIII.\\n\\nParis.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the middle of the afternoon, we reached the Northern Railway Terminus\\n_(Embarcadere du Nord) _ in Paris. This magnificent station covers nearly\\n10 acres of ground. The arrival and departure sheds in the center are 230\\nmetres long, and 70 metres wide. (The meter is equal to 39.370079 inches).\\nIts facade is 180 metres long, 38 metres (about 125 feet) high and\\nconsists of a lofty central arch and two lateral arches. This imposing\\nfront is adorned with twenty-three colossal statues of noble female\\nfigures, representing the following, principal cities of Europe: Paris,\\n(surmounting the central arch), Londres, St. Petersburg, Berlin,\\nFrankfort, Vienne, Bruixelles, Cologne, Amsterdam, Donai, Dunkerque,\\nBoulogne, Compeigne, St. Quentin, Cambrai, Beauvais, Lille, Armiens,\\nRouen, Arras, Laon, Calais, Valengiens. (1864).\\n\\nThere are a number of other very fine railway stations in Paris, but we\\ncan only take room to define their area. The largest is the Strasbourg\\nRailway Terminus, nearly 13 acres in extent; while the Western Railway\\nTerminus covers an area of 5 acres.\\n\\nAs soon as our train had stopped, I followed my French companion (Prof.\\nS.) into the extensive apartments of the station, and passed muster. I\\nexpected to be asked for my \\\"passport,\\\" but slipped through unchallenged.\\nOn passing out into the yard I was again saluted by my English friends who\\nwere about entering a \\\"bus\\\" to drive to a hotel. In bidding each other\\ngood-by and god-speed on our journeys, I ran a great risk of losing my\\nParisian friend, in the great multitude of people that thronged the yard\\nand pavement; but fortunately, I found him again in a few minutes.\\n\\nBefore we reached the street, I was already made to feel that some strange\\nscenes and experiences were undoubtedly in store for me in Paris and\\nlikely throughout the rest of my continental tour, for I had already\\nobserved one of those strange social habits of the Parisians in a most\\npublic place which the nice delicacies of our language and customs forbid\\nto describe.\\n\\nThe French, the Italians, and many of the inhabitants of South Germany and\\nparts of Switzerland--I should say all the sunny lands in Europe--have\\nhanded down to our day, manners and customs which speak in a language that\\ncannot be misunderstood, and with a force far louder than a whisper, that\\n_it is not very long since man took to dressing himself_. In my\\nintercourse with those people, from Paris to Egypt, I nowhere observed any\\nbaneful influences exerted over morality by these practices in question,\\nfor they are not thought about by those people which are guilty of them,\\nbut many an American will be shocked at them, and go home declaring that\\nsuch indecencies _must_ lead to immoralities, even if they have never gone\\nto the trouble to see whether they actually _do_. Their pernicious\\ninfluence upon American tastes and manners may be granted, but that does\\nnot prove that foreigners, who are cradled, nursed and brought up in these\\ncustoms, will be affected in like manner. American and English tourists\\nare alike shocked and provoked at the sight of the innumerable nude\\nstatues and paintings, on the, pleasure gardens and in the art galleries,\\nbut the ladies of the continent seem to see as little of indecencies or\\nimproprieties in those things, as we do in opening our Bibles and seeing\\nsaints and apostles represented with bare feet--the _toes_ standing out\\nnaked over the sandals, or when we read in the family circle and in the\\npublic capacity of teachers and ministers, passages from Scriptures,\\nsuch as no one would be capable of reading if they were found in a\\nperiodical or a newspaper.\\n\\nDuring my first month on the continent, I was often vexed to think that\\nmuch of what I saw, that was not only very interesting and impressive, but\\nwhich had likewise an important bearing on history, was of such a nature\\nthat it would either constitute unfit material for general diffusion, or\\nseem to be incredible to the average reader.\\n\\nWe went down Boulevard (pron. Bool'var') de Magenta about one-third of a\\nmile, to Boulevard de Strasbourg, (pron. Straws'boor'), thence along that\\navenue (?) to the foot of it (another third of a mile) and continued our\\nwalk down Boulevard de Sebastopol to Rue de Rivoli, along which latter\\nstreet we went half a mile west, where my friend, guide and teacher\\nprocured for me a room not far from _his_ home.\\n\\n[With this gentleman I spent from three to five hours daily, during my\\nfirst stay of fifteen days, in walking about the city seeing sights and\\nstudying French reading and pronunciation].\\n\\nAs soon as I had taken my room, I retraced my steps to the railway station\\nand fetched my sachel; this time, alone. It was not a little task, for the\\ndistance from my quarters, which were near the center of Paris, to the\\nstation, was over two miles. The names of the Boulevards \\\"Magenta,\\nStrasbourg and Sebastopol,\\\" I was constantly repeating in my mind, so that\\nI might not forget the way that I had come with my friend, the first time.\\nIt was dark by the time I reached my lodging place the second time, but I\\nhad seen and learned enough for one day. Almost two miles of _Boulevards_\\nand nearly half a mile of Rue de Rivoli (the finest _Rue_ in Paris) thrice\\nwalked that afternoon, had presented to me more that was new, than I had\\nexpected to see in a week.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Boulevards,\\n\\n\\nlike a dozen other of the distinguishing features of Paris, are _new\\nthings_ to the American; and as they are quite different from anything\\nthat I have yet seen of the kind in this country, I shall here take room\\nto note some of their striking characteristics. They are the grandest\\nstreets in Paris, sustaining about the same relation to the \\\"Rues\\\" that\\nthe avenues in our American cities sustain to the streets. In the French\\nnomenclature, the names applied the different classes of thoroughfares,\\n&c., run as follows: 1st., avenues; 2nd., boulevards; 3rd., rues; 4th.,\\nallees or ruelles, and 5th., passages (pron. pahsahjes). In America, the\\ncorresponding terms are 1st., avenues; 2nd.,----; 3rd., streets; 4th.,\\nalleys, and 5th., passages. It will be observed, that we have here nothing\\nto correspond with the boulevard. In the classification here presented,\\nthe term avenue is to designate thoroughfares of great width and shaded\\nwith rows of trees on each side, as are the avenues in Washington, D.C. In\\nmost American cities, the avenues are diagonal streets or openings\\nconnecting distant points of the cities, but this definition loses most of\\nits force when applied to European cities, as they are not built square or\\nrectangular.\\n\\nChamps Elysees intersects a fine and extensive reservation, (having many\\nof the characteristics of the pleasure garden), extending from the Jardin\\ndes Tuileries (Garden of the Tuileries) to the Arc de Triomphe (the Arch\\nof Triumph). Its length is a mile and a quarter, and the garden or park of\\nwhich it is the grand thoroughfare, is, in one place, about a third of a\\nmile in width. The buildings are consequently a considerable distance off\\nfrom this carriage-way; but in the boulevards, nothing except the pavement\\nintervenes between the street and the houses. The boulevards of Paris are\\nits widest as well as its noblest streets. The pavements on each side of\\nthem, are, in many instances from twenty-five to thirty feet in width.\\nThick rows of large and elegant shade-trees border them on both sides, and\\nunder these are placed numerous wooden settees for the accommodation of\\nthe public. Many of the 6,000 cafes which are strewn over Paris, grace\\nthese boulevards with their glass fronts. During the summer season, most\\nof the refreshments and meals are served in front of the cafes on the\\npavements, and grand is the sight of seeing ten thousand gay Parisians\\nseated along these splendid streets, chattering away over their wine and\\ncoffee! Paris is about five miles long by four miles wide, and few are the\\nhouses in the entire city that are less than five or six stories high. A\\nfew only of the outer streets have as low as four and five story houses.\\nThese houses are mostly built of stone, having stone floors, even. Each\\nroom is arched over from the four walls; upon these arches are placed the\\nflagstones constituting the next floor, and it is in consequence of this\\narching that each story is so very high. The white sandstone of the Paris\\nbasin constitutes the principal building stone. The city is divided into\\nseven sections, and each section is required by law, to either scrape the\\nfronts of their houses once every seven years, so that the walls look new\\nagain, or to paint them anew. No proprietor can choose his time, but when\\nthe year is come for his section to repair their houses, it must be done.\\nIn consequence of this regulation, the streets never look _checkered_ by\\nold and new houses contrasting with each other, but the external\\nappearance of the buildings is made to harmonize, and each street is a\\nunit in appearance. In the finest part of Paris there are few alleys or\\nstables, but splendid rues and boulevards lined with magnificent buildings\\nwith elegant fronts, have taken their places. This section is over three\\nmiles in length, nearly two in width, and presents scenes of beauty,\\ngrandeur and magnificence which are _unrivaled_ by anything that the first\\nother cities of the world have ever brought forth.\\n\\nIts beautiful balconies, as numerous as the windows, constitute another\\nvery charming feature of Parisian scenery. The streets are always kept\\nclean and wet by sweepers and sprinklers, and the broad smooth pavements\\nalong the boulevards, free from dust and all manner of rubbish or\\nobstructions, afford a suitable promenade for gayety, wealth and fashion\\nto roam. Here beauty's feet may stray, arrayed in the most showy colors or\\nthe stateliest attire, without fear of encountering nasty crossings or of\\nbeing splashed over and soiled by teams upon muddy streets. Ladies\\nattired in gaudy ball-room dresses with long trails, would scarcely\\npresent a contrast in dress with the average promenaders. All dress\\nequally well, on Sundays, and on week-days, so that Paris presents to the\\nforeigner, the appearance of a city celebrating an eternal Sabbath. Even\\nwhen it rains, the pedestrian can walk _for miles_ about the city, without\\nbeing in want of an umbrella. In that event he need only confine his\\ncourse to the\\n\\n\\n\\nArcades and Passages.\\n\\n\\nWebster defines an arcade as \\\"A long, arched building or gallery lined on\\neach side with shops.\\\" May the reader not be misled by this definition;\\nfor the arcades of Paris do not have shops on _both_ sides. They are a\\nuniform system of porticoes generally from twenty to thirty feet in width.\\nThose on Rue de Rivoli are about a mile in length, and the houses to which\\nthey belong have been exempted from taxes for thirty years. From these\\nramify numerous passages and other arcades, connecting different parts of\\nthe city.\\n\\nA \\\"Passage\\\" (pron. p\\u00e4-sahj) is a street covered with a glass roof,\\nelegantly paved, animals and vehicles excluded or shut off, and lined by\\nthe first-class shops in the city. The most remarkable are the Passages\\ndes Panoramas, Jouffroy, Verdean, Vivienne, Colbert, Choiseul, Delorine du\\nSaumon, &c. The first of these are the most brilliant and are perhaps not\\nexcelled or even equaled by any other in the world, with the solitary\\nexception of Passage des Victor Emanuel of Milan, in Italy. Some of these\\npassages are called\\n\\n\\n\\nGalleries.\\n\\n\\nThe Galerie d'Orleans in Palais Royal, is a good example. This lofty hall,\\nforty feet wide and 300 feet long, extending between a double range of\\nshops, connects the arcades extending around the other three sides of the\\ninner court of that palace, (now turned into shops, bazaars, etc.)\\n\\nMany of the grand boulevards and rues of Paris have been built since 1848,\\nand the work of widening and improving old streets and building new ones\\nis still going on with constantly increasing vigor.\\n\\nThere are now in progress of construction, broad boulevards, which can\\nonly be constructed at the sacrifice of many acres of some of the finest\\nbuildings in Paris; but only beauty and grandeur are regarded anything in\\nthis noble city, expenses being but little estimated. Notwithstanding the\\nlavish expenditure of money upon this class of improvements, Paris is, of\\nall cities, perhaps the most prosperous on the globe.\\n\\nOf the wide-spread destruction of public buildings, occasioned by the late\\nwar and the stormy days of the Commune, there are but few marks remaining.\\nThe Palace of the Tuileries, Hotel de Ville, and a few other buildings,\\nlie still in ruins; but the thirty or more churches which were either\\ngreatly damaged or quite demolished, and numerous other public edifices\\nthat have been destroyed, have already been restored--some of them with\\nincreased magnificence. Besides this, the French have almost finished\\npaying their immense war-debt, while America, whose war ended seven years\\nbefore theirs, is obliged to sail into the centennial year, still heavily\\nfreighted with the obnoxious burden.\\n\\nDid heaven ever smile upon a more blessed city than Paris? To give the\\nreader an idea of how buildings are torn down to make room for the purpose\\nof extending fine streets, let us refer to the statistics concerning Rue\\nde Rivoli. This street cost $30,000,000. It is two miles in length, and\\nits establishment caused the demolition of upwards of one thousand houses!\\nThirty millions of dollars, enough to pay for a tract of land that is\\ntwenty miles long and eleven miles wide, bought at the rate of $200 per\\nacre; and all this expended on the improvement of two miles of road!\\n\\nIn the Old World, a strip of three to five or six story houses, several\\nhundred feet wide and a quarter of a mile to upwards of a mile in length,\\nis torn down with as much complacent indifference concerning the\\ndestruction, as men manifest in mowing so much grass!\\n\\nAs among the most fashionable places in Paris, may be mentioned, Boulevard\\ndes Italiens, Palais Royal, Champs Elysees, Jardin des Tuileries and\\nother pleasure gardens and public squares. Boulevard des Italiens, in\\nfair weather, is densely crowded with ladies and gentlemen seated on\\nchairs hired for two to three sous (cents) each. The city clears over\\n$7,000 a year from this source of revenue. But several hundred steps\\ntoward the west of this street stand the Academic de Musique (the most\\nsplendid opera-house in the world) and the Grand Hotel--two of the most\\nbrilliant edifices in the city.\\n\\n\\n\\nPalais Royal,\\n\\n\\nas it now stands, was completed in 1786. This building, like most of the\\npalaces in Europe, is built around a quadrangle, and its plan may be\\ncompared to a pupil's slate used for ciphering. The frame corresponds to\\nthe form or ground-plan of the buildings, and the slate, to the court or\\nyard which they inclose. This inner court or garden, 700 feet long and 300\\nfeet wide, containing nearly five acres of land, is planted with lime\\n(linden?) trees from end to end, and two flower gardens. In the middle is\\na fine _jet d'eau_ (a fountain). \\\"The garden was thus arranged in 1799; it\\ncontains bronze copies of Diane a la Biche of the Louvre, and the Apollo\\nBelvedere; two modern statues in white marble, one of a young man about to\\nbathe, by d'Espercieux; the other of a boy struggling with a goat, by\\nLemoine; Ulysses on the sea-shore, by Bra; and Eurydice stung by the\\nsnake, by Nanteuil, a fine copy in bronze, but more fitted for a gallery\\nthan the place it now occupies. Near this statue is a _solar cannon_,\\nwhich is fired by the sun when it reaches the meridian, and regulates the\\nclocks of Palais Royal.\\\"\\n\\nFrom the privilege of supplying refreshments and from the hiring of\\nchairs, the Government derives an annual rent of $7,000.\\n\\nThe shops under the arcades are chiefly devoted to articles of luxury, and\\nare among the most elegant in Paris. Many restaurants are on the first\\nfloor; here, were formerly the gambling-houses which rendered this place\\nso notorious. The best time for visiting Palais Royal is in the evening,\\nwhen the garden and arcades are brilliantly illuminated and full of\\npeople. The shops of the watch-makers and the diamond windows are then\\nparticularly brilliant. In the most magnificent windows the articles have\\nno price marks; but in the best windows in which the articles have price\\nmarks, I saw lockets priced $200; rings for $900; ear-rings for $1,000 a\\npair; a pair of diamond studs for $2,800; crosses for $320; and a necklace\\nworth $3,000.\\n\\nPalais Royal has been called the capital of Paris. During the early part\\nof the first Revolution, its gardens became the resort of the most violent\\npoliticians; here, the tri-coloured cockade was first adopted, and the\\npopular party decided on many of its bolder measures.\\n\\nThere is little room for doubt, that the Cafe, one of the characteristic\\nfeatures of French society, is a potent factor in civilizing and refining\\nthe human race, in these latter times. Religion and intelligence--moral\\nideas, moral habits and the collective knowledge of our ancestors--has\\nbeen transmitted from one generation to another down to our time, by the\\nChurch and the Schools, principally. But the affairs of the human race\\nhave taken a new turn since the invention of printing, by which the steady\\ndevelopment of traditional ideas has been arrested, so that the propriety\\nof retaining the standards of ancient civilization as patterns for the\\npresent, is being questioned and discussed everywhere. In this great\\nrevolutionary era, the authority of the past and even the respect\\nnaturally due to parents is very generally disregarded. This latter sad\\nfeature of failing to do homage to the aged, is not more the result of a\\nlack of love and esteem, on the part of children for their parents, than\\nof the want of confidence which parents have in themselves. We can take an\\nillustration from our young ladies. A few generations ago, the traditional\\nwhite cap constituted the head-dress of the young maidens among the\\ncatechumens, when they presented themselves for the first time at the\\naltar; now, in place of having all the heads look alike, every head must\\npresent a different phase. We still find sections in the Old World, where\\nall the dresses of the young are \\\"cut out of the same piece,\\\" so to say,\\nand made after the same pattern, so that all the individuals of a company\\nare almost as nearly dressed alike, as soldiers in uniform. Rev. Bausman,\\nin his Wayside Gleanings, page 141, in describing the appearance of people\\nat church in a certain section of Germany, portrays one feature in these\\nwords: \\\"Very pleasant was it to see every lady, old and young, having her\\nhymn book carefully folded in her white handkerchief.\\\" The clergy, and the\\nmonks and nuns in Europe display like uniformity in their dress. In every\\nold picture or painting, representing a group or company of persons, it\\nwill be observed that all the individuals are dressed and combed after the\\nsame fashion.\\n\\nThis incessant yearning and seeking for something new is of recent date,\\nand the key-note of a universal system of revolutions. Every season brings\\na new style of dress, and what is true of fashion is true of everything\\nelse. As it would ill become mothers to leave their family for a time and\\nlearn the milliners' trade, she makes choice of one of her daughters to be\\neducated in that trade. This young girl after she has learned dressmaking\\ntakes the place of the mother in the matter of providing clothes for the\\nfamily, and becomes in a large measure the mistress of the house. The same\\nthing happens to the baking department of the family. A score of new kinds\\nof pies and cakes have become fashionable in our day, and it is the\\ndaughters that have the greatest opportunity to earn this baking of\\npastries the quickest. The consequence is that the mother soon turns out\\nto be only a _second rate cook!_ Fully aware that she can neither cook nor\\nmake dresses, she resigns her position as head of these departments,\\nrespectively to her daughters, who, when once master of the culinary and\\nmillinery, affairs, will soon be master of the balance of the household\\naffairs. Need I say that the fathers of this generation are served about\\nthe same way by their sons? And it is the same between the teacher and the\\npupil. \\\"Old fogy teacher\\\" or \\\"he has the old ways yet\\\" are expressions\\nthat are too common to require any explanation. Happily, most old teachers\\nhave cleared the turf, and yielded their laurels to a host of youngsters,\\nranging in age from about sixteen to twenty years! Thus all difficulties\\nare surmounted in this line, and \\\"Young America\\\" has the reins to himself!\\nLook at the improvements that have resulted from the efforts of inventive\\ngenius, and at the progress that the arts and sciences have made. We are\\nin a _new world_, so different from that of our forefathers, that their\\nexperiences count almost nothing in this new era. It is a sad picture to\\nsee the young and the inexperienced thus groping in the dark, but it is\\nthe inevitable consequence of the new turn that things have taken since\\nthe inauguration of the _age of reason_ [dating from the introduction of\\nprinting (?)], Nevertheless, the young would display much greater\\nprudence, if they would bring many of their schemes and purposes to a\\nlower temperature by sitting still when age rises to speak, and were they\\nto take heed of the counsels and admonitions of those who are older than\\nthemselves.\\n\\nThis radical change in the affairs of the world being recognized, it\\nbecomes apparent how the power and influence of the Church and Schools\\nmust abate in a measure, and give scope, for a season, to a class of\\ninstitutions more fitted for revolutionary times. This transition era will\\nlikely be marked as a glacial period in the history of religion, during\\nwhich time rationalism and infidelity will possibly be rampant in Europe,\\nif indeed they do not even establish their dominion in America, But we may\\nhope for a calm after the storm, when things will be steadied down again\\nto a smooth and even flow. In this our time, the transition era, theaters,\\noperas, cafes and the printing press, will play a very important part; the\\npress for the literary public in general, the theaters and operas for the\\nsocial benefit of the upper class and the cafe for the middle and _large\\nclass_, the class which give shape and character to the predominant\\nmethods of social evolution. The first cafe in Paris was established in\\n1697 by an Armenian, and like the establishment of the Hippodrome in New\\nYork by Barnum, was a success from the beginning. These institutions\\nincreased rapidly in number under Louis XV., and became the favorite\\nresort of distinguished individuals. At present, they abound in every\\nquarter, and justly rank among the most remarkable features of the city,\\nbeing very generally decorated with unrivaled costliness and splendor.\\nBesides coffee, wine, beer and other refreshments, they frequently provide\\nbreakfast, and many of them also dinners and suppers. In 1874, there were\\nover 6,000 cafes in Paris, doing business to the amount of $24,000,000\\nannually, or an average income of $4,000 to each establishment! The\\nfurniture of the cafe and the plan of conducting its business resembles\\nthat of our fashionable ice-cream saloons more than any other\\nestablishment that we are acquainted with. The halls are furnished with\\nlittle tables or marble-stands surrounded by chairs or costly sofas, and\\nevery person that enters, is expected to order some kind of drink or\\nrefreshment as soon as he has taken his seat. Both sexes frequent them\\nalike, and a grand sight it is to see a brilliant company of ladies and\\ngentlemen sitting in groups and couples about these gorgeously decorated\\nhalls, enjoying their wine and each other's company, thus presenting\\nscenes of gayety and festive pleasure that are seldom outvied, even in the\\nball-room and the opera in this country. A band of musicians render music\\nfrom an elevated platform all evening, and an open space in front of the\\nplatform is provided for the accommodation of those who delight in the\\ndance. The waiting girls of these cafes are usually ladies of remarkable\\nbeauty and refinement, whose elegant dresses, graceful manners and rare\\naccomplishment in conversation and address, are well in keeping with the\\ncharming brilliancy of the hall, and the merryand refined company around\\nthem.\\n\\nIt is astonishing how cheap these splendid accommodations of the cafe,\\nalmost princely in their style, can be rendered. A person may enter a cafe\\nearly in the evening, sit down with his friends and acquaintances, order a\\nglass of wine or beer and enjoy the best music and the pleasures of the\\nmost refined society for an hour or two, and when he leaves, his purse is\\nonly from three to eight cents the poorer for it. A gentleman may take a\\nlady to the cafe _five_ evenings in a week, for between thirty cents and a\\ndollar. He may spent twice as much or even ten or fifty times as much, if\\nhe washes to spend his time in a building whose very window sashes and\\nexternal ornamentations glitter with gold; but such a lavish expenditure\\nof money is not _required_ to be comfortable and happy. These cafes are\\nvery orderly houses. It is not fashionable to consume a glass of wine or\\nbeer in less than half an hour, and many drink the whole evening at one\\nglass. No one can get drunk at this rate, and any one who would drink fast\\nand should become wild, he would not be tolerated in the cafe, as no lady\\nwould remain in his society.\\n\\nThere are some fast drinking-houses even in Paris, and more in some\\nsections of Germany, but even those sent few or no drunk men upon the\\nstreets. A fellow that would stagger upon the pavement would be conducted\\nto the station house at once. I did not see a single drunk person in Paris\\nin half a month's stay, and only several in the rest of my tour through\\nEurope. It is an encouraging sign of the times, that the cafe is being\\nintroduced in America. May it soon take the place of our gambling-halls\\nand drinking-hells. See what Macaulay says of the Cafe, as he is quoted by\\nWebster in his Unabridged Dictionary under the word Coffee-house.\\n\\n\\n\\nChamps Elysees,\\n\\n\\nChamps Elysees, (pron. Shangs-ai-le-zai), a term equivalent to \\\"The\\nElysian Fields\\\" of the Greeks, is perhaps the most charming place in the\\nworld. It is a paradise in reality, as its names implies; and during the\\nsummer evenings, when its many thousand gas jets blaze in globes of\\nvarious colors, and the magnificent illuminations of its grand cafes\\nproduce a brilliancy of coloured light intense enough to see pins on its\\nwalks and flower-beds, the scenes become grand beyond description. Immense\\nthrongs of people gather around the cafes in the evening to see the youths\\nand beauties whirl in the mazy dance, and listen to the bewitching strains\\nof the sweet music there rendered. It is not a rare thing to see\\nspectators go into raptures on these occasions, for I have seen few places\\nwhere nature and art so harmonize and unite in producing scenes of\\nenchanting beauty and creating feelings of ecstatic delight, as here on\\nChamps Elysees. The atmosphere of Paris, too, is preeminently soft and\\nbalmy, and the temperature so even that ladies may sit in the most\\nbrilliant attire all evening in the open air under the trees of this\\npleasure-garden without the least danger of contracting a cold. One of the\\nfirst evenings that I enjoyed these scenes of indescribable beauty, I\\ncould not help but observe to my companion, that the finest poetical\\ndescriptions of a celestial Paradise, were not ideal representations of\\nimaginary pleasures, but true word images of the joys and beauties of the\\n\\\"Elysian Fields\\\" (Champs Ely sees) in Paris.\\n\\nThe buildings which front upon this lovely place are among the most\\nelegant in the city, being finely painted, even on the outside, like those\\nin the boulevards. I saw one, whose balconies were all gilt, from the\\nbottom to the attic story, reminding one of the splendor of the foremost\\nroyal mansions.\\n\\nPalais de l'Elysee, lies contiguous to this place and gave origin to its\\nname. It was a favorite residence of Napoleon I. When he returned from\\nElba, he occupied it until after the defeat of Waterloo. It was also the\\nofficial residence of Napoleon III. while he was President of the French\\nRepublic. At present it is occupied by Marshal MacMahon during the\\nrecesses of the National Assembly.\\n\\nIn about the center of Champs Elysees, is the Palais de l'Industrie, the\\ngreat Exhibition Buildings, in which the World's Fair was held in 1855.\\n\\nThe Avenue des Champs Elysees intersects Champs Elysees, and is a mile and\\na quarter in length. Its foot-pavements are twelve feet wide, This is the\\nfavorite walk of the gay Parisians.\\n\\n\\\"On sunny winter-days, or cool summer-evenings numerous parties of all\\nclasses are seen, enjoying the lively spectacle before them, seated on\\niron chairs hired for three or four sous, (cents), or on the wooden\\nbenches placed at intervals on the sides of the avenue, while elegant\\ncarriages roll in procession along the road.\\\"--_Galignani's Paris Guide_.\\n\\nPlace de la Concorde, called Place de la Revolution in 1792, (when the\\nguillotine was erected here), is at the east end of Champs Elysees,\\nadjoining the Jardin des Tuileries. The square is enclosed with\\nbalustrades, upon which stand eight colossal statues of the chief\\nprovincial cities. In the center of it stands the Obelish of Luxor. This\\nmagnificent monument of ancient Egypt, was brought to Paris in 1833 and\\nerected in 1836. It weighs 250 tons, and to transport it from Thebes to\\nthe place where it now stands required three years. It is one of two\\nmonoliths that stood in front of the great temple of Thebes, where they\\nwere erected 1550 years before Christ. Both of them were given to the\\nFrench Government, by Mehemet All, Viceroy of Egypt, \\\"in consideration of\\nadvantages conferred by France on Egypt in aiding to form the arsenal and\\nnaval establishment of Alexandria.\\\" Only one was removed. It is 72 feet 3\\ninches high. Its greatest width is 7 feet 6 inches at the base, and 5 feet\\n4 inches at the top. The pedestal upon which it stands, is 15 feet by 9\\nfeet at the bottom and 8 feet at the top, and weighs 120 tons.\\n\\nThe transportation and re-erection of this obelisk cost the French\\nGovernment about $400,000. A dear present! No wonder that they did not go\\nto fetch the other one.\\n\\nGalignani enumerates the following events which occurred here and rendered\\nthe Place de la Concorde famous:\\n\\n\\\"July 12, 1789.--A collision between Prince de Lambesc's regiment and the\\npeople became the signal for the destruction of the Bastille.\\n\\n\\\"Jan. 21, 1793.--Louis XVI. suffered death on this place.\\n\\n\\\"From Jan. 21, 1793, to May 3, 1795, more than 2,800 persons were executed\\nhere by the guillotine.\\n\\n\\\"Feb. 23, 1848.--The first disturbances that ushered in the memorable\\nrevolution of that year took place here.\\n\\n\\\"Feb. 24, 1848--Flight of Louis Philippe and his family by the western\\nentrance of the Tuileries Garden.\\n\\n\\\"Nov. 4, 1848.--The Constitution of the Republic was solemnly proclaimed\\nhere, in the presence of the Constituent Assembly.\\n\\n\\\"Sept. 4, 1870.--The downfall of Napoleon III. and the Third Republic\\nproclaimed, after the disaster of Sedan.\\n\\n\\\"May 22, 1871.--A desperate conflict between the Versailles troops and the\\nCommunists, the latter in their retreat setting fire to public and private\\nBubldings.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nJardin des Tuileries,\\n\\n\\nA pleasure-garden over fifty acres in extent (containing flower-beds, an\\nextensive orangery, trees, statues and fountains) intervenes between Place\\nde la Concorde and the Palace of the Tuileries, and, in connection with\\nChamps Elysees, constitutes a continuous garden and park whose total\\nlength is over a mile and three quarters.\\n\\nThis magnificent reservation penetrates almost to the heart of the city.\\nIts width is in one place nearly half a mile, being about one fifth of a\\nmile wide at the Tuileries on the east, while it tapers down to about 450\\nfeet (the width of Avenue des Champs Elysees) at the Arch of Triumph on\\nthe west end of it. The Avenue des Champs Elysees and the principal avenue\\nin the Tuileries Garden are in a perfectly strait line, so that a person\\nstanding in the center of the avenue at the Tuileries will see both sides\\nof the Arch of Triumph, nearly two miles away from him; while the center\\nis concealed from his view by the Obelisk of Luxor standing in the center\\nof Place de la Concorde, as above described. Stepping a few yards to\\neither side throws the obelisk out of the way and affords one a perfect\\nview of that noble arch (one of the most stately monuments in existence).\\nThe tourist can not approach that imposing monument called\\n\\n\\n\\nArc de Triomphe de L'Etoile\\n\\n\\nto greater advantage than by this avenue, starting out from the ruins of\\nthe Tuileries. As some of the finest scenes and most important places in\\nParis are met with, by this approach, one should allot a whole day to this\\nwalk. He will have half a mile to the obelisk in the center of Place de la\\nConcorde, which, with its surroundings, will require him hours to see.\\nThree thousand feet further, is the Rond Point of Champs Elysees. A\\nquarter of a mile short of this, he will have found the Exhibition\\nBuildings on his left and Palais de l'Elysees on his right. Having seen\\nthese, he may make his approach of the Arch of Triumph without further\\ninterruption. From Rond Point to the Center of the arch, it is about 3,800\\nfeet more. It is only after the visitor comes within half a mile of its\\nbase that the monument begins to assume its gigantic proportions. This\\nproud monument was designed by Chalgrin, having been decreed by Napoleon\\nI. in 1806. The work was suspended from 1814 till 1823; labor was resumed\\nthen, but it was not completed before 1836. Thus, thirty years of time and\\nover $2,000,000 were bestowed upon the erection of this historic monument,\\nwhich is perhaps destined to hand down to future generations both the\\nnames of the victors and of the numerous vanquished cities that were\\nsubject to the authority of Napoleon I. The great central arch is\\nforty-five feet wide and ninety feet high, over which rises a bold\\nentablature and the crowning attic. The transversal arch is twenty-five\\nfeet wide and fifty-seven feet high. The total height of the monument\\nbeing 152 feet; and its breadth and depth 137 feet and 68 feet\\nrespectively. The fronts of the structure are towards Champs Elysees and\\nPorte de Neuilly, the city gate near Bois de Boulogne.\\n\\nThe general plan of this imposing monument is borrowed from that of the\\nfamous arches at Rome; but the transversal arch is an additional feature,\\nwhile its reliefs, and inscriptions, and its colossal proportions throw\\nthe arches of Rome into comparative insignificance. The interior sides of\\nthe piers are inscribed with the names of ninety-six victories; under the\\ntransversal arches are the names of generals. A group upon the northern\\npier of the eastern front represents the departure of the army in\\n1792:--\\\"The Genius of War summons the nation to arms.\\\" The group on the\\nsouthern front represents the triumph of 1810:--Victory is in the act of\\ncrowning Napoleon. History with pencil in hand is about to record his\\ndeeds upon a tablet before her; conquered towns are at his feet. Fame\\nsurmounts the whole, blowing her bugle of praise. The group on the\\nsouthern pier of the western front represents the French nation's\\nresistance to the invading army of 1814:--A young man defends his wife,\\nhis children and his father; a warrior falls slain from his horse, and the\\nGenius of the Future encourages them to action. Upon the northern pier is\\nrepresented the peace of 1815:--The warrior sheathes his sword, the farmer\\nhas caught a bull with a rope, and is taming him for purposes of\\nagriculture, while a mother with her children is sitting by, and Minerva\\nsheds her protecting influence over them. Every group is 36 feet in height\\nand each figure 18 feet.\\n\\nA chain fence encircles this proud and noble monument, and shuts off all\\nconveyances. Pedestrians can enter until dusk. An ascent of 272 steps\\nbrings the visitor to the platform at the top, from which one of the\\nfinest views of Paris and the surrounding country may be enjoyed.\\n\\nThere are three other triumphal arches in Paris. The oldest is that of\\nPorte St. Denis. It was erected by the city of Paris in 1672. The\\nprincipal arch is 25 feet wide, and 43 feet high; and the total height of\\nthe structure is 72 feet. Its reliefs and other representations are\\nsuperb.\\n\\nThe triumphal arch over Porte St. Martin is 54 feet wide by 54 feet high.\\nThe central arch is 15 feet wide by 30 feet in elevation. It was built in\\n1674, two years after the erection of Porte St. Denis.\\n\\nThe last of the three inferior arches was erected by order of Napoleon in\\n1806. It has a base of 60 feet by 20 feet, and is 45 feet high. The cost\\nof erection was about $275,000. It stands near the Tuileries at the Place\\ndu Carrousel, after which it was named, and which was so called from a\\ngreat tournament held by Louis XIV. in 1662. The entablature is supported\\nby eight Corinthian columns of marble, with bases and capitals of bronze,\\nadorned with eagles. The attic of this arch is surmounted by a figure of\\nVictory in a triumphal car with four bronze horses hitched to it. These\\nwere modelled by Bosio from the celebrated historic horses which Napoleon\\nbrought from Venice to Paris in 1797, but which were restored by the\\nallies in 1815, and now stand again in the Piazza of St. Mark at Venice,\\nas they had since 1205. The original (those in Venice) are gilt, but those\\nin Paris are black.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Tomb of Napoleon I.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe tomb and last burial place of the great Napoleon, which is in Eglise\\ndes Invalids, is perhaps the most imposing monument of the kind in the\\nworld. I have not found its equal anywhere; nor anything to rival it even,\\nin costliness and splendor, except those of several of the Popes at Rome.\\nThe tomb which covers the sarcophagus into which the mortal remains of\\nNapoleon I. brought from St. Helena, were placed April 2nd, 1861, consists\\nof a immense monolith of porphyry weighing 67 tons, brought from Lake\\nOnega in Russia at an expense of $28,000. This tomb, 13\\u00bd feet in height,\\nstands in the center of a circular crypt, and is surrounded by twelve\\ncolossal statues representing so many victories. The pavement of the crypt\\ncontains a crown of laurels in mosaic, and a black circle upon which are\\ninscribed the names of the following victories: Rivoli, Pyramids, Marengo,\\nAusterlitz, Iena, Friedland, Wagram and Moskowa. A large bouquet of\\nimmortelles (everlasting flowers) lying upon the tomb is emblamatic of the\\nimmortality of the great soldier's fame. Over the bronze door which leads\\nto the crypt, are inscribed the following words, quoted from the Emperor's\\nwill:\\n\\n \\\"Je desire que mes cendres reposent sur les bordes de la Seine, au\\n milieu de ce peuple Francais que j'ai tant aime.\\\"\\n\\n \\\"I wish my remains to be laid on the banks of the Seine, amongst that\\n French people whom I have loved so much.\\\"--_P. Simond_.\\n\\nIn the center of an adjoining chapel, stands the tomb of Joseph, King of\\nSpain, the eldest brother of Napoleon I. His mortal remains were brought\\nhither in 1864.\\n\\nThe dome which rises over the tomb of Napoleon I. is one of the proudest\\nmonuments in Paris, and its gilt and glittering cupola may be seen many\\nmiles around. The cross on top of the globe and spire surmounting this\\ndome is 323 feet above the pavement. Leaving Eglise des Invalids from the\\nsouthern entrance, which leads to the tomb of Napoleon I., a spectacle\\npresents itself to the beholder in the form of a grand fountain throwing\\nits water high into the air. It is at\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Artesian Well of Grenelle.\\n\\n\\nM. Mulot commenced to bore at this well in 1834, but did not succeed in\\nreaching water until February 26th, 1841, by which time his boring\\ninstrument had reached the depth of 1,800 feet, and the water suddenly\\ngushed forth with tremendous force. The whole depth is lined by a\\ngalvanized iron tube that is 21 inches in diameter at the top and 7 inches\\nat the bottom. The, amount of water yielded every 24 hours is 170,940\\ngallons. Its temperature is about 82 degrees Fahrenheit.\\n\\nTwenty years after the sinking of this well, that is in 1861,\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Artesian Well of Passy,\\n\\n\\nnear the Arch of Triumph, was completed. This yielded at first 5,000,000\\ngallons in 24 hours; it yields now over 3,000,000 gallons per day. A third\\nartesian well is in Boulevard de la Gare.\\n\\nThere are, besides these artesian wells, 35 monumental fountains, 88 plain\\nfountains and over 2,000 water-plugs in the city.\\n\\n\\n\\nNotre Dame.\\n\\n\\nThe Cathedral Church of Notre Dame is the grandest church of the\\nrose-window class that I met with in my whole tour of Europe, The length\\nof this edifice is 390 feet, and its greatest width at the transepts 144\\nfeet. It is said to be capable of holding 21,000 persons. The nave is 225\\nfeet long, 39 feet wide and 102 feet in height to the vaulting; the\\nwindows are 36 feet high. Its two western towers are each 204 feet high,\\nand the spire about 270 feet. The first thing that arrests the attention\\nof the visitor on approaching it, are the grotesque figures of its antique\\ngargoyles, several hundred in all, which give the church a very odd\\nappearance. The three portals (at the west end) contain about 300 images.\\nIts organ is 36 feet broad, 45 feet high and contains 3,484 pipes. But\\namong the most remarkable features of this magnificent cathedral are its\\nsplendid rose-windows, representing a variety of scripture and legendary\\nsubjects, and its choir and sacristy. Here, are mitres and crosses\\nglittering with jewels, and the church-utensils and vestments. The most\\ngorgeous are the robes worn by Pius VII. at the coronation of Napoleon I.,\\nand several series of brilliant robes profusely embroidered in silver and\\ngold. It seems that the place upon which Notre Dame now stands, was first\\noccupied by a heathen temple erected in the time of the Romans; for, among\\nnine large stones dug up in 1711, one bears the effigy of the Gallic deity\\nHesus, and the other was a votive altar raised to Jove.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Pantheon.\\n\\n\\nAbout half a mile distant from the island of the Seine upon which Notre\\nDame stands, on an eminence south of the river, is located the Pantheon,\\nor church of St. Genevieve. This building cost $6,000,000. The six fluted\\ncolumns of its portico are 6 feet in diameter and 60 feet high. The whole\\nnumber of Corinthian columns in and about this superb edifice is 258. The\\narched ceilings of the interior are 80 feet high. The dome is 66 feet in\\ndiameter and its height from the pavement to the top is 268 feet. I have\\nseen no other dome in Europe that resembles so closely the dome on the\\nCapitol of the United States, both on account of its fine illumination by\\nnatural light, and in its general design. One section of the frescoes in\\nthe canopy of the dome on our national capitol, represents the deification\\nof Washington. In the dome of the Pantheon at Paris, Clovis, Charlemagne,\\nSt. Louis and Louis XVIII., are represented as rendering homage to Ste.\\nGenevieve, who descends towards them on clouds, and Glory embraces\\nNapoleon. In the heavenly regions are represented, Louis XVI. and Marie\\nAntoinette, Louis XVII. and Madame Elizabeth.\\n\\nIn 1791, Mirabeau was interred here with great pomp, and in the same year\\ntook place, the celebrated apotheoses (deifications) of Voltaire and\\nRousseau. The remains of Mirabeau and of Marat were afterwards\\ndepantheonized, and the body of the latter was thrown into a common sewer.\\n\\nThe vaults are under the western nave. In these the \\\"monuments and funeral\\nurns are arranged like the Roman tombs in Pompeii.\\\" There are two\\nconcentric passages in the center, where small sounds are repeated by\\nloud echoes. A hand holding a torch issues from one side of Rousseau's\\ntomb, meaning that he is a light to the world even after death.\\n\\n\\n\\nLa Madeleine\\n\\n\\nis the third and the last of the large churches of Paris to which I can\\ndirect particular attention. It is 328 feet long by 138 feet wide,\\ncovering over an acre of ground, and its erection cost over $2,500,000.\\nThis structure was commenced in 1764, but the work was suspended during\\nthe revolution of 1789. Napoleon had once directed Vignon to complete it\\nfor a Temple of Glory, but Louis XVIII. restored it to its original\\ndestination in 1815. It is approached at each end by a flight of 28 steps,\\n(the same number that constitute the Scala Sancta at Rome), extending\\nalong the whole length of the facade; and a Corinthian colonnade of 52\\ncolumns, each 49 feet high and five feet in diameter, surrounds it on\\nevery side.\\n\\nThere are scores of other churches in Paris that are interesting on\\naccount of the various styles of architecture which they represent, but I\\nwill only make mention of one more, and that on account of its terrible\\nhistorical associations. It is the church of St. Germain l'auxerrois\\n(pron. sang jer-mang lo-zher-wa). It was from the belfry of this church,\\nthat the signal was given for the commencement of the Massacre of St.\\nBartholomew, August 23rd, 1572. Its bells tolled during the whole of that\\ndreadful night. This church was the theater of another outbreak on the\\n13th of February, 1831, when everything within the church was destroyed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Louvre.\\n\\n\\nThe reader may form an idea of the extent of these buildings, when he\\nreflects that the space covered and inclosed by the Old and New Louvre and\\nthe Tuileries, is upwards of sixty acres. The court of the louvre is one\\nof the finest in Europe, and its art galleries are among the richest in\\nthe world. The Long Gallery alone covers nearly an acre and a quarter,\\nbeing 42 feet wide and 1,322 feet long! A person can well spend weeks or\\neven months in the museum of the Louvre, but simply to walk through all of\\nits brilliant galleries will require about three hours! I cannot stop to\\nsay more than that its collections of paintings and of sculpture is\\nprobably much larger than any other in the world.\\n\\nBesides what I have already described and enumerated, Paris has its Bois\\nde Boulogne containing large botanical and zological gardens, three race\\ncourses, the longest nearly two miles in circuit, lakes and drives; also\\nmany other gardens, squares, towers, columns, &c.--all full of beauty or\\ninteresting on account of the historical events and incidents associated\\nwith them; but I must now devote the remainder of my space to the\\n\\n\\n\\nTheatres, Operas\\n\\n\\nand other places of amusement of the great capital of the social world.\\nPlaces of amusement are the leading feature of Paris, and a boundless\\nvariety, adapted to the wants and tastes of every class of society, are\\nstrewn in endless profusion all over the city. The concert season lasts\\nalmost all the year round, though the highest class are limited to the\\nwinter and spring. Masked balls take place throughout the Carnival, in the\\nwinter season, and are thus spoken of and described by Galignani: \\\"The\\nmost amusing are at the Opera-house, where they begin at midnight and\\ncontinue till daybreak. No stranger who visits Paris at this season of the\\nyear should omit a visit to one of the _Bals masques_ at this theater, for\\nit is difficult to imagine a scene more curious and fantastic than that\\npresented in the _Salle_ of the Grand Opera at a Carnival Ball. On these\\nnights the pit is boarded over and joins the stage; the vast area of the\\nwhole theater forming a ball-room of magnificent proportions, which,\\nbrilliantly lighted, and crowded with thousands of gay maskers attired in\\nevery variety of colour and costume, forms a sight not easily forgotten.\\nLadies should not go except as spectators in a box and under the\\nprotection of their relatives. The ticket costs $2.00. To witness this\\nscene in perfection the visitor should wait until 12 or 1 o'clock, when\\nthe company is completely assembled and the votaries of the dance are in\\nfull activity. On entering the vast _salle_ at such a moment the effect is\\nscarcely imaginable, the gorgeousness of the immense theater, the glitter\\nof the lights, the brilliancy and variety of the costumes, the enlivening\\nstrains of music, the mirth of the browd, and, above all, the the\\nuntiring velocity with which the dancers whirl themselves through the\\nmazes of the waltz, polka and mazourka, present an appearance of\\nbewindering gayety not to be described. * * * * On some occasions of\\nspecial enthusiasm the crowd take up the leader of the orchestra with the\\nmost frantic plaudits, and in more than one instance have carried him in\\ntriumph round the theater. It is scarcely necessary to add that at these\\nballs the _roue_ (profligate) may find an endless variety of pleasant\\nadventures.\\\" On some days during the Carnival, crowds of masked persons,\\nexhibiting all sorts of antics, appear in the streets, and people assemble\\non horseback, in carriages and on foot, to witness the scene.\\n\\n\\\"The Carnival was prohibited in 1790, and not resumed till Bonaparte was\\nelected first consul.\\\" Great was the joy of the Parisians when the\\nCarnival was again restored!\\n\\nThe Opera-house referred to in the extract above quoted, is the Academie\\nNationals de Musique, or French Opera-house, also sometimes called the new\\nOpera-house. It is generally admitted to be the finest Opera-house in the\\nworld. The space covered by this magnificent building is 140 metres by\\n122, (about 470 feet by 410), or nearly four and a half acres. It has\\nseats for 2,520 spectators. The staircases, walls and ceiling are of the\\nfinest marble. The \\\"house\\\" for the spectators or audience is built\\nentirely of stone and iron, rich in decorations and thick with gold. The\\nstage alone is a quarter of an acre in extent, being 128 feet wide by 85\\nfeet long. Below the stage there is a depth of 47 feet, from which the\\nscenes are drawn up all in one piece. This abyss below the stage was\\nobtained at an immense cost, as the architect had to lay the foundations\\nfar below a subterranean body of water, but the advantage thus gained\\nenables them to present scenes that are marvelous. \\\"The singers in this\\nopera are pupils of the Conservatoire, and the _corps de ballet_ consists\\nof the most distinguished dancers of the day. Great attention is paid to\\ncostume and general effect.\\\" During the matchless performances of a night\\nthat I was present, there were at one time nine large horses and a\\nprocession of several hundred actors upon the stage, and it was far from\\nbeing full. One of the most beautiful and astounding performances of the\\nnight was the production of a series of transformations that were as\\nsudden and as astonishing in their developments as is the metamorphosis of\\nthe gaudy butterfly from the groveling worm. As the curtain rose there\\nstood upon the stage a mighty fortress, massive and strong. We had seen it\\nbut long enough to observe how thick and how rough from age its\\nweather-beaten walls were, when there was heard a crash, and the mighty\\ncitadel had fallen out of sight; but there still remained a most\\nbeautiful castle which must have been contained inside of the citadel but\\nhid from the view by its towering walls. This castle was beautiful beyond\\ndescription. It was fairer far than the castles of the kings seem to be,\\nexcept when \\\"distance lends enchantment to their view.\\\" But the second\\nscene was as ephemeral as the first. We beheld its fascinating beauties\\nonly a few seconds when its four walls again dropped into the abyss below,\\nand there issued from its inner apartment a host of beautiful little\\nactresses such as I did not see upon any other stage in Europe. These\\nlittle fairy-like beauties, many perhaps not more than from 5 to 10 years\\nof age, all dressed in the most brilliant costumes, at once skipped into a\\ndance \\\"running the ring and tracing the mazy round,\\\" to the great\\nsatisfaction of the admiring spectators, who were as much delighted by the\\ngayety, grace and accomplishment which they displayed in their\\nperformances, as they have been astonished at their sudden and almost\\nmiraculous appearance.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt a Ball.\\n\\n\\nDancing is the favorite amusement in Paris, and these exercises are\\nconducted on a grand scale, even during the summer season. I attended a\\nPublic Ball one evening, when almost the entire floor (covering nearly\\nthree fourths of an acre) and the adjoining garden of about the same area,\\nwere thronged by thousands of gay and jovial dancers, all wild from the\\nexcitement produced by the rhythmical motions and music of that playful\\nexercise.\\n\\n\\n\\nIncidents.\\n\\n\\nThe reader can not be more curious to know how one that is unacquainted\\nwith the French language can get along in Paris, than I was when I first\\ntook up my residence there. The first morning I went out to seek some\\nplace where I might get fresh milk; _Lait_ is the French name of it as I\\nfound it in my conversational guide book. I soon found that name upon a\\ncard of pasteboard hanging at the door of a shop where bread and fruits\\nwere displayed in the window. On entering the store a clever Frenchman\\npolitely addressed me, but he soon discovered that I was none of the\\n_loquacious_ kind, in French. I asked for _lait_, pronouncing the word as\\nif it was spelt l-a-t-e, but he did not understand me. I could adorn my\\nconversation neither with verbs nor with adjectives, so I repeated the\\nword _lait_ several times with the rising inflection, by which he readily\\ninferred that I wanted something, though what that something was, remained\\na mistery to him, all the same. By and by, I pointed out the word lait to\\nhim, on seeing which, he exclaimed \\\"---- du l\\u00e1!\\\" and gave me what I\\nwanted. Thereafter I visited him from two to five times every day,\\naccording to convenience, to get my \\\"du l[=a]_it!_\\\". Of \\\"du p\\u00e4_in_\\\"\\n(bread) and smoked sausages, I constantly kept a supply in my satchel, so\\nthat when I entered a new city, I could well get along until I had become\\nacquainted. Fruits and a very healthy and nutricious kind of nuts, (the\\nBrazilian nuts), I bought in great abundance and exceedingly cheap from\\nsuch as hawked them about on the streets. Five to ten centimes (1 to 2\\ncents) would buy 7 or 8 large Brazilian nuts and 6 to 8 fine juicy pears,\\nor as many delicious plums, of which I was extremely fond. By thus\\nreducing the number and variety of my dishes at the regular meals, I only\\nenhanced the pleasures of the palate instead of reducing them; for he who\\n\\\"does not eat but when he is hungry, nor drink except when he is thirsty,\\\"\\nwill enjoy the humblest meal much more than the pampered dedauchee can\\nrelish the richest feast. As beer does not please my palate, and because\\nthe water fountains of Paris were often out of my reach when I was\\nthirsty, I soon took fruit to supply the place of drink, and thus, in\\nParis already, I laid the foundation of a dietary system that ensured me\\nnot only health, happiness and convenience of procuring it alike in all\\ncountries, but that proved to be very economical too. For from 40 to 60\\ncents a day, I supplied all the necessaries, and more of the luxuries of\\nlife, than most of us are accustomed to, even in voluptuous America.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter IX.\\n\\nVersailles.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn my voyage across the Atlantic, I had formed the friendship of a young\\nclergyman, (Rev. O.), of New York, who wished to make a summer vacation\\ntour through western Europe, visiting Ireland, Scotland, England, France,\\nItaly, Switzerland and Germany. On comparing programmes, we noticed that\\nhe would likely come to Paris during the time that I had alotted to that\\ncity. We therefore agreed that each should drop a letter to the other,\\nimmediately after reaching Paris, so that he who should happen to come\\nlast might at once know where to find the other. One evening, when I came\\nhome, the card of Rev. O., my American friend, was handed to me by the\\nlandlord, who informed me by his gestures that he had been there to call\\non me. The card was backed by a note asking me to meet him at No.--,\\nRue--------. Though that street is perhaps not more than an eighth of a\\nmile long, I soon found it upon my map of Paris, which was a very\\nexcellent one, as the maps of all large foreign cities generally are and\\nmust be, in order that persons who cannot speak the languages of those\\ncities, may still be able to find any places without asking any one where\\nthey are or which way to go. The map of Paris, for example, is divided\\ninto numerous squares by arbitrary lines. Those which run vertically down\\nthe map are lettered, and those which cross it horizontally are numbered.\\nAt the side of the map is a table of all the streets, with references to\\nthe squares on the map, designating between what lines they are found, or\\nwhich they intersect. By the aid of such a map, I started out the next\\nmorning to meet my friend, whose quarters were in a distant part of the\\ncity, about three miles away. I found him without difficulty. He was\\naccompanied by two gentlemen from London that had come with him to see\\nParis and its environs. It is both novel and pleasant for two such lonely\\npilgrims as my New York friend and I were when we left home, to meet each\\nother again in a foreign city, and introduce to each other the friends\\nwhich one picked up by the way. We soon agreed to go all together to\\nVersailles, the French Capital, that day. This was Tuesday, July 27th. At\\n10:40 a.m., we crossed the fortifications of Paris, and soon came into\\nview of Bois de Boulogne, the great park of Paris. Five minutes later we\\ncrossed the Seine at St. Cloud, a small town, where we stopped to see the\\nruins occasioned by the siege of Paris in 1870. We had considerable\\ntrouble, however, in identifying the strongholds and redoubts held by the\\nPrussians in that memorable siege, as nobody seemed to understand any of\\nour French! On one occasion, Rev. O., while asking a lady for a certain\\nplace, called on Mr. K----, one of the Londoners, to come and see whether\\nhe could make this woman understand any of _his_ French! It was altogether\\na day of odd adventures and fun. After enjoying the lovely prospects an\\nhour, we walked another hour in great perplexity as to what directions we\\nshould take to find a railway station where we might take a train for\\nVersailles, but finally succeeded. We did not understand more from those\\nwho directed us, than the direction we should take, never knowing the\\ndistance. It is more than a joke, for a party to be obliged to walk\\nseveral miles for a station, when they had expected to reach it in a\\nquarter or half a mile at most! When we arrived at the station at Sevres,\\nour difficulties only commenced. \\\"When will the next train leave for\\nVersailles, and where can we procure our tickets?\\\" were questions which\\nengaged our best energies and all our ingenuity for half an hour, besides\\na rash adventure on my part, before they were solved. (It seems to me now,\\nthat throughout my tour, I always got into more trouble when I had company\\nto rely upon, than when I was alone). By means of motions with our hands\\nand by pronouncing the name Versailles, we made them understand where we\\nintended to go to; but when we asked for \\\"billets,\\\" they did not offer us\\nany. They showed us, however, that the train was due at 1:10, by pointing\\nout those figures on the dial of the clock. About 15 minutes before the\\ntrain was due, we asked again for tickets, and when they were again\\nrefused, we began to fear that the tickets had to be procured on the\\nopposite side of the railroad. We therefore crossed by a foot-bridge near\\nthe station, but could not approach the house on the other side, on\\naccount of the high fence which shut every body off from the tracks. When\\nour plans were thus frustrated our company became alarmed with the fear\\nthat we might miss the train for want of tickets, and fail to see\\nVersailles that day. At this crisis I ascended the bridge and climbed down\\nalong the walls on the inside of the fence; suspending myself from the\\nlowest iron bars along the bridge, I thus dropped myself into the yard\\nbelow! But our discouragement reached its climax, when I found that the\\ndoor was closed and locked, which we had hoped was the ticket office. I\\ncould not get out of that inclosure, as the fences were high, the gates\\nlocked and the bridge from which I had dropped myself, was out of my\\nreach. Several railroad men saw me immediately, who appeared as much\\nastonished at my coming into that place, as I was perplexed in my awkward\\nposition. I did not misinterpret their French this time, however, for the\\nway they looked up toward the sky, and their gestures and chattering,\\nplainly indicated that they wondered where I came from. I motioned them\\nthat I came \\\"from above,\\\" and pointed toward the bridge. What fine or\\npunishment might have been inflicted for my intrusion I do not know, but\\nI was only rebuked in language which I did not understand, and sent out\\nthrough one of the office doors which they unlocked for the purpose. My\\ncompanions were now in great glee at this termination of my adventure, one\\nof them observing that I might soon be landed in _close quarters_, at my\\npresent rate of progress! I responded that we were a party corporate, and\\nthat three fourths of what any one did was to the credit of the other\\nthree. The train soon came, and we took our places on the top of the cars\\nand rode on to Versailles. This was the only ride I had in two-story\\nrailway cars, but our trip was such a delightful one in the second story\\nof those cars, that I often wished for like accommodations again.\\n\\nThe National Assembly was in session when we reached Versailles, but we\\ncould not gain admittance. We immediately went to the Palace, which is\\ndevoted to the reception of a rich and splendid historical museum\\nunparalleled in Europe. There are altogether some 34 salles or galleries,\\nwhich require upwards of an hour to walk through. The paintings are\\narranged chronologically, and it is this classification, as well as the\\nmagnitude of the collection, that render the museum one of the most famous\\nin Europe. Adjoining this palace, are the gardens and park, upon the\\nestablishment and improvement of which, Louis XIV., (1616) spent\\n$200,000,000! This immense sum would pay a tract of land 100 miles long\\nand 10 miles wide, bought at $300 per acre! Many millions have since been\\nspent upon it. It is at the present day one of the finest pleasure-gardens\\nin Europe. Its fountains are among the most magnificent in existence.\\nThese are made to play only once (the first Sunday) every month; to supply\\nthe water in sufficient aboundance for this magnificent display, costs on\\neach occasion $2,000! It is a source of the purest happiness for a party\\nof Republicans, as ours was, to see the very palace and gardens which\\nNapoleon III. once occupied as a royal mansion, now held as the common\\nproperty and the peaceful promenade of the pleasure-seeking masses. How\\nchanged the scene! That which was prepaired for the king, is now enjoyed\\nby the common people. Such are the fruits of the French Republic, which\\nhas now broken the fetters of royalty for the third time.\\n\\nOn Sunday, August 1st., I visited this garden and park again, this time to\\nsee the fountains play. It is impossible to do justice to this\\npleasure-garden even in two days. In the center is the grand canal 186\\nfeet wide and nearly a mile long, intersected at right angles by another\\ncanal that is 3,000 feet long. My rambles were confined to the section\\nintervening between the palace and the Bassin d'Apollon, which is at the\\nnearer end of the Grand Canal. The fountains and jets in this section,\\nnorth and south of the Allee du Tapis Vert (green lawn), are almost\\ninnumerable. They do not all play at the same time, so the crowd can\\nfollow them from basin to basin until Neptune with his numerous jets, the\\nlast and the greatest of them all, is reached. The Terrasse du Chateau\\nwith Silenus, Antinous, Apollo and Bacchus, after the antique, lies next\\nto the palace. Immediately below is the Parterre d'Eau, upon whose border\\nrepose twenty-four magnificent groups in bronze, namely, eight groups of\\nchildren, eight nymphs and the four principal rivers of France, with their\\ntributaries. Toward the left of this lies the Parterre du Midi, and still\\nfurther south, along the palace, lies the Orangerie. A flight of 103 steps\\nlead down to an iron gate on the road to Brest.\\n\\nParterre de Latone lies in advance of Parterre d'Eau, which two paterres\\n(pits) the Allee du Tapis Vert (green carpet) and the Grand Canal, lie in\\na straight line and present a charming view nearly a mile and a quarter in\\nlength. Bassin Latone is surrounded by a semi-circular terrace crowned\\nwith yew-trees and a range of statues and groups in marble. (It would\\nrequire the space of a volume to describe all the fine statuary of this\\ngarden). This fountain consists of five circular basins rising one above\\nthe other in the form of a pyramid, surmounted by a group of Latona with\\nApollo and Diana. \\\"The goddess implores the vengeance of Jupiter against\\nthe peasants of Libya, who refused her water, and the peasants, already\\nmetamorphosed, some half, and others entirely, into frogs and tortoises,\\nare placed on the edge of the different tablets, and throw forth water\\nupon Latona in every direction, thus forming liquid arches of the most\\nbeautiful effect.\\\" Walking down the green velvet lawn, we came to the\\nBassin d'Apollon. Apollo, the God of Day, is emerging from the water in a\\nchariot drawn by four horses, and surrounded by a throng of sea-monsters.\\nSeveral other fountains represent the seasons. Spring is represented by\\nFlora and Summer by Ceres. Winter appears in a group representing Saturn\\nsurrounded by children; and Bacchus, reclining upon grapes and surrounded\\nby infant satyrs, represents Autumn. Near the Tapis Vert, in the midst of\\na dense grove, is a magnificent rotunda composed of 32 marble columns,\\nunited by arches and supporting a number of marble vases. Under the\\narcades, are a circular range of fountains, \\\"and in the middle is a fine\\ngroup of the Rape of Proserpine.\\\"\\n\\nThe largest and most splendid fountain in the park, is the Bassin de\\nNeptune. Upon its southern border stand 22 ornamental vases, each with a\\njet in the center. Against the same side, are three colossal groups in\\nlead. The central one represents Neptune and Amphitrite seated in an\\nimmense shell and surrounded by tritons, nymphs and sea-monsters. On the\\nleft is Oceanus resting upon a sea-unicorn, and on the right, Proteus, the\\nson of Oceanus. There are several other groups; and from the jets of\\nthese, amounting to some 55 or 60 in all, issues a deluge of water, when\\nthe gates are opened. A quarter of an hour in advance of the appointed\\ntime, about 15,000 persons had assembled upon the circular terrace, facing\\nthis magnificent fountain, and were waiting with breathless anxiety to see\\nold Neptune take his turn. We had seen the wonders and beauties presented\\nby the other fountains as they shot their silvery columns, and clouds of\\nvapor high into the air, or spanned their pyramidal basins with\\ninnumerable liquid arches intersecting each other in every conceivable\\ndirection; but the grandest sight, it was said, was still in store for us.\\nAll the other fountains had commenced their playing with humble\\nspasms--the columns rising higher by degrees, but old Neptune took every\\nbody by surprise. Hundreds leaped and shouted for joy, when they saw that\\nthe southern heavens, which had been so clear and beautiful but a moment\\nbefore, were suddenly whitened with clouds of vapor upon which the rays of\\nthe western sun produced a most charming effect. A gentle breeze gave to\\neach spouting jet, a misty tail, comet-like in appearance to the admiring\\nspectators.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Incident\\n\\n\\nwhich added much to my pleasures and enjoyments of that glorious day,\\ndeserves notice here, as it illustrates that if one even starts to make\\nthe tour of the world alone, so that he may not be detained by the\\nloiterings of a companion whose tastes and fancies differ from his, need\\nnot therefore be without pleasant associates when he is in want of them.\\nEarly in the afternoon, as I was about taking my seat under the shade of a\\nyew-tree on a terrace where I might have a fair view of Bassin de Latone,\\n(the play of whose liquid arches render it the most _beautiful_ of all in\\nthe garden), I was accidentally met by the same English party with whom I\\nhad traveled from London to Paris. It was a happy meeting indeed, and the\\nincidents of our walks and conversations upon that pleasure-garden will\\never remain fresh and green on memory's tablet. They had finished their\\ntour of Germany and returned in time to spent the great day of the month\\nat Versailles. As the band was discoursing excellent music, the fountains\\nplaying, and crowds of people streaming hither and thither in the midst of\\nthese splendid scenes, one of the ladies passed a remark which I only\\nlearned to appreciate fully, several months afterwards. She said, \\\"_I love\\nthe quiet English Sabbath_.\\\" Her father had experienced before what the\\ncontinental Sabbath was, but his daughters, though they appreciated these\\ncharming scenes none the less, would have preferred them on week-days;\\nfor, nearly a month of sight-seeing among a people who keep no Sundays\\nsuch as we do, had made them long for a day of sweet and silent repose.\\nSeveral months later, after I had traveled through France, Belgium,\\nGermany, Switzerland and Italy, without finding a day of rest such as\\nEngland and America make of their Sundays, I felt that even the\\npleasure-seeker should rest one day in seven. Often thought of the \\\"quiet\\nEnglish\\\" and American Sabbaths.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter X.\\n\\nLeaving Paris.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the 6th of August, after a stay of fifteen happy days in Paris, I began\\nto make preparations to leave for Brussels. I had walked during that time\\naccording to my daily register, about 140 miles, making an average of over\\n9 miles per day, for I could not avail myself of the omnibuses and city\\ncars, as I had done in London; because I could not make myself understood\\nin French.\\n\\nParis had presented so much that was new or radically different from what\\nI had seen elsewhere in the world, even London not excepted, that I felt\\njustified in addressing the following conclusion to an American\\njournalist:--In Paris, there is such a harmonious combination of\\ncivilizing and refining instrumentalities and influences, which, if I do\\nnot elsewhere find a nearer approach to than I have thus far, will not\\nonly throw sufficient light upon the question, \\\"How does she lead the\\nnations in thought and fashion,\\\" that the most thoughtless may be able to\\nsolve it, but which will even entitle her to be styled _queen of cities\\nand Capital of the social world._\\n\\nAs I had definitely decided to return from Egypt to America by way of\\nParis, in order that I might see the great city once more toward the end\\nof my tour, and be the better qualified to estimate her true position in\\nthe world, I made a little bundle of the guide books and views, which I\\nhad already accumulated on my trip, and also dropped some of the\\nsuperfluities of my wardrobe--these things I gave into the care of my\\nchamberlain, and bade good-by to Paris for a season. My friend and tutor\\nProf. P.S., accompanied me to the station and bought me a ticket for\\nBrussels, as we call it in our language, but the French and Belgians call\\nit Bruixelle (pron. Broo-[)i]x-el). My friend informed me of this and gave\\nme a drill on pronouncing the word correctly, for if I should have called\\nit Brussels, no Frenchman would have understood what I meant. I was now\\nabout to leave the only acquaintance that could speak my language, and go\\nto another people of the same strange language as the Parisians speak,\\nwith no right to expect that I should be so lucky again in meeting a\\nsuitable companion. I had ordered my mail to be forwarded to Cologne,\\nGermany, until September 1st. At 11:15 p.m., August 6th, the train moved\\naway with me toward Belgium.\\n\\nI had forgotten to ask how often and where I must \\\"change cars\\\" from Paris\\nto Brussels, and now, where no one understood either English or German,\\nwhat could be done! Possibly, I need not make a change all night; and\\nperhaps I should at the next station already! How readily my friend could\\nhave informed me, had I only asked him! But I managed to keep the right\\ntrack, though at the expense of considerable anxiety and the sacrifice of\\nsome rest and sleep that I might otherwise have enjoyed during that\\nnight-journey. I learned a lesson, however, which aided me in avoiding\\nsuch perplexities in the future. As soon is we reached the first station,\\nI ran to a conductor and, holding up my ticket, cried out, \\\"Broox-el?\\\" He\\nunderstood me and motioned me to keep my seat. Some accommodating\\nFrenchman soon told me that he was traveling the same way for a\\nconsiderable distance, (as his ticket also made clear to me), and offered\\nkindly to inform me when I had to leave that train. My peace of mind being\\nthus restored again, I made a pillow of my satchel and went to sleep.\\n\\nThe next forenoon (Saturday, August 7th) we reached Douane, where we had\\nto pass muster under the Belgian custom-house officers. I was now with the\\nwooden-shoed Belgians. A large company of the poor peasants passed muster\\nwith me. Each was provided with a pick or a hoe, or both, lying over his\\nshoulder, and a large flaxen bag of other implements, &c., suspended from\\nit. Nearly all wore caps, and the whole company looked very shabby,\\nindeed. My clothes were in strange contrast with their tattered garments,\\nfor there was not another well-dressed passenger in the whole company; and\\nI felt like one out of his element, because I did not also have a pick or\\nhoe! A hundred Belgians with a hundred bundles crowded into several small\\napartments of the station, found little room for their, careers, which\\nconsisted of the irony ends of their picks and hoes, so that those\\noccasionally hooked the prominent points of the faces of those immediately\\nbehind them! Strange to say, these collisions did not provoke any to\\ninsults or the use of vulgar adverbs, but gentle reproofs kept them all\\ncool and steady till we entered the cars again. The reader will pardon me\\nfor saying that a similar crowd of persons in this country, placed under\\nthe same tempting and exasperating circumstances, would have created a row\\nin five minutes, as would be the natural consequence if there were but a\\nsingle ruffian in the whole lot. Nothing will strike the American tourist\\nmore when he comes to the Old World, than the good order which prevails\\neverywhere. To meet two persons scolding and insulting each other, is an\\nextremely rare occurrence. The orderly behavior of such a company of\\npeasants will impress one more with the importance of teaching the young,\\nlessons of patience, humility and _obedience_ (which latter quality of\\ncharacter is the mother of a hundred virtues), than volumes of dry\\nphilosophy on social ethics will generally avail.\\n\\nI saw an elderly lady kiss a middle-aged man alternately upon each cheek;\\nan incident that is common in European social life, and that shows how the\\naffections of the heart are cultivated and find expression. In Brussels I\\nsaw a son rest his hand affectionately upon his mother's shoulder, as they\\nstood amongst the multitude in a public square.\\n\\nI reached Bruixelle (Brussels) at about three o'clock in the afternoon. In\\norder to see what kind of money was in circulation in Belgium, I\\nimmediately bought some pears of a fruit-woman, and handed her half a\\nfranc (10 cents). You may imagine how I was perplexed when the lady handed\\nme a dozen coins of various sizes and values, as my change. Knowing,\\nhowever, that though the coins had different impressions, the-system was\\nthe same as that of French money, I murmered to myself, \\\"Blessed be the\\nDecimal System,\\\" and went to some retired quarter to count it! One piece\\nwas a large whitish coin marked 10c., and worth 2 cents in our money;\\nothers were centimes, which are equivalent to but one fifth of our cent! I\\nsoon learned to know them all.\\n\\nAfter having taken a long walk through the city, I engaged a room at a\\nhotel where one of the boarders could speak a little English, and soon\\nretired to take an afternoon nap. I awoke to broad daylight, but did not\\nat once know whether it was _that day_, or _the next day already_; and\\nthere was no one about, just then, whom I could have asked! As the sun was\\nstanding in the western sky, I concluded that it was more likely that I\\nhad slept only a few hours, than that I should have slept 27 hours; and\\nwhen the landlord was contended with the payment of one night's lodging, I\\nfelt satisfied that I could not have stayed two nights with him! On\\nSaturday afternoon, after my nap, I went out again to see the city.\\nBrussels is one of the most progressive capitals in all Europe. Several\\nsplendid boulevards lined with fine cafes and large edifices adorned with\\ninnumerable balconies, reminded me of Paris and its architectural scenery.\\nIt has a passage that compares well, both in brilliancy and magnificence,\\nwith some of the grandest in Paris. The Bourse de Commerce, (just\\ncompleted), with its four elegant facades, would do credit to any city,\\nand its market houses are among the finest that I have ever seen.\\n\\nOn Sunday (August 8th) I found all kinds of business being transacted,\\njust as is done in Paris. On my way to the Cathedral, I met a dozen\\ndog-teams that Sunday morning. Quite a small dog will draw a larger cart\\nload of milk, than I would have expected that half a dozen of them could\\npull. The milk is distributed over the city by women, principally. It\\nseems strange, how much work must be done by the women, where the men are\\nrequired to spend a large portion of their time in the service of their\\nrespective countries, constituting the large standing armies with which\\nEurope is flooded. Some of these women have large dogs to draw their\\nmilk-carts, others have smaller ones hitched to one side and assist them\\nby pulling themselves on the other side of the shaft!\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Cathedral (St. Gudule),\\n\\n\\nis a grand old church, some portions of it dating from the 13th and 14th\\ncenturies. \\\"It is rich in old stained glass and monuments. The carved\\nwooden pulpit by Verbr\\u00fcggen (1699) represents the expulsion of Adam and\\nEve from Paradise.\\\" The choir renders excellent music. An odd feature in\\nthe religious exercises of this church, is the manner in which the choir\\nis noticed when to sing, by the ringing of a common bell.\\n\\n\\n\\nHotel de Ville.\\n\\n\\nHotel de Ville (the Town Hall) is an elegant building dating from the 15th\\ncentury. It is four stories high to the roof, besides there are 4 rows of\\ndormer-windows in the roof (four stories in the garret!) Its graceful\\ntower is 506 (?) steps, 364 feet high. The view from the top is\\nmagnificent. Behind this building, at the crossing of two fine streets,\\nstands the curious \\\"mannikin ----\\\" statue and fountain, evidently a relic\\nof the _shameless age_.\\n\\nI spent some of my time with an intelligent merchant who had been\\ntraveling in America, and could, in consequence, speak the English quite\\nwell. He informed me that he was not aware that Belgium had any\\nSunday-laws upon her statutes. Any one may do upon the Sabbath-day\\neverything that he might do on week-days, if he feels so inclined. On\\nSunday afternoon, I left Brussels for Antwerp (Anvers). Nothing can be\\nmore delightful than the rural scenery of Belgium. The whole country is\\nas carefully tilled as a garden--every foot of available soil being under\\ncultivation. Most of the dwelling houses are small, but everything about\\nthe houses, yards and gardens is kept in the most perfect order.\\nOccasionally, a beautiful vista opens to a fine residence in the distance.\\nAs we rode along in the cars, we would occasionally see an afternoon or\\nevening party seated around a richly laden table glittering with\\nglassware, and enjoy their dinners and suppers under some shade trees in\\nthe midst of their gardens. This custom is common in Europe, and presents\\nmost beautiful and homely sights.\\n\\nSoon after I had entered the cars, I noticed that the tone of the\\nconversation among the passengers was different from what I had been\\naccustomed to hear in France and Belgium thus far. I now heard the chatter\\nof the Dutch, but understood no more than if it had been so much French.\\nDutch and German are two entirely different languages. Dutch print in the\\nnewspapers does, however, not look so perfectly strange, as the\\nconversation sounds to the ear.\\n\\nAfter arriving at Antwerp I was soon found by a porter who conducted me to\\na German Hotel. How social and hospitable these Germans are--and, I must\\nadd, Europeans in general. _Die \\\"Deutsche Wirthschaft\\\"_ (German Hotel)\\noccupied quite a small building, which presented a very ordinary\\nappearance on the outside, but I shall never forget that carpeted\\nbar-room, the costly furniture of the parlor, and the accommodating\\nlandlady which we found there. Taste and comfort are always consulted,\\neven where the greatest simplicity prevails.\\n\\n\\n\\nAntwerp\\n\\n\\nis one of the most Catholic cities (some say the most Catholic city) in\\nthe world. Its streets are filled with images of the Virgin and Child, the\\nSavior and the Cross. These stand at the corners of the crossings, or\\npreside over the street lamps. On one of its church towers, over a gas\\nlight, is represented a candle stick with the rays emanating from its\\nlight. On each side, is a little cherub--one has a cross and the other an\\nanchor. Over them, stand the mystical letters \\\"IHS,\\\" the cross being\\ncombined with the H after the fashion of a monogram. Beneath is the\\nfollowing inscription:\\n\\n GELOOFD\\n ZY JESUS CHRISTUS\\n IN HET ALLERHEYLIGSTE\\n SACRAMENT.\\n\\nIn another part of the city I found a representation of the crucifixion,\\nthe cross upon which Christ is nailed being about 20 feet high. Effigies\\nof two women in oriental costume stand on either side of it.\\n\\nIn Antwerp, as in Brussels, the spirit of progress: has seized the leading\\ncircles, and the hand of improvement has commenced tearing down her\\nancient houses and building new streets upon the modern plan and style of\\narchitecture. One of the most handsome avenues in the world, being from\\n290 to 350 feet in width, and about two miles long, runs through the very\\nheart of this city. It has several moderate angles, which render it\\nconvenient to assign different names to different sections of it. Avenue\\ndu Commerce reaches from the northern end of the city to its magnificent\\nsquares in the center, known as Place de la Commune and Place de la\\nVictoire. Here begins Avenue des Arts, which, with Avenue de l'Industrie,\\nleads to the southern confines of the city. These avenues consist of three\\nparallel roadways with two broad foot-pavements between them, and wide\\npavements at the sides. Let us cross this avenue from one side to the\\nother, and estimate the width of its different parts. First we cross a\\nbroad payement of perhaps 30 feet; then a roadway of about 50 feet; next a\\nfoot-pavement lined by thick rows of trees whose branches form an arch\\nover it; then the central roadway, perhaps 150 feet wide; and afterwards,\\nanother foot-pavement, a roadway and the pavement on the other side,\\ncorresponding with those already mentioned. The great square in the center\\nof the city occupies about 6 acres. In this section of Antwerp, nearly all\\nthe old buildings have been torn down and new ones erected during the last\\nfew years; and in many other sections the same work of widening streets\\nand erecting new buildings in place of the old, is being done with\\nreckless haste. It seems as if old houses were regarded as a disgrace to\\nthe city. That few images are to be seen in the new sections of the city,\\nis a sure sign that commerce, art and industry (see the names of three\\navenues which run through this city) have sounded the tocsin of\\nrevolution, and that the ancient religion with its emblems, forms and\\nceremonies, is yielding to the spirit of modern civilization and\\nrefinement, as many other cities of Europe have already done.\\n\\nIt is a remarkable fact, that as Catholicism sinks in Continental Europe,\\nits communicants will not stop to join Prodestantism, but go strait over\\nto Rationalism. France, for example, has had these two extreme elements\\nfighting each other for the ascendency, for a long time, and no\\nmiddle-road sentiment ever gained a foothold. Prodestant Europe will cling\\nto the church the longest, and, do we not already see the indications very\\nplanely that after all Europe has turned rationalistic, America will\\ncontinue to cherish the church and built her a Rome for future generations\\nto bless as the fostering mother of modern Christianity?\\n\\n\\n\\nNotre Dame Cathedral.\\n\\n\\nThe Cathedral is the most elegant Gothic Church in Belgium, and one of the\\nmost famous in the world. Some parts of it date from the 13th and others\\nfrom the 16th centuries. The spire (403 feet in height) is a proud rival\\nof that on the Cathedral of Strasbourg, and its chimes of 99 bells are\\ndeservedly famous. Within the church, are some of the most celebrated\\npaintings of Rubens. Among them are \\\"Descent from the Cross,\\\" (considered\\nhis master piece), \\\"Elevation of the Cross,\\\" \\\"Assumption\\\" and\\n\\\"Resurrection.\\\" The interior of this church is ornamented with master\\npaintings and fine works of art in lavish profusion. The cathedral is free\\nin the morning, but at noon the paintings of Rubens are unveiled, and a\\nfee of 1 fr. is charged for admission. There were about 35 other tourists\\nthere during the afternoon that I visited it.\\n\\nThe Church of St. Jaques contains the tomb of Rubens, and many pictures, a\\nnumber of them veiled and shown only for a fee.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Museum.\\n\\n\\nThe museum contains some of the best (most natural) paintings in Europe.\\nThe pencil of Rubens has imitated nature so perfectly that the eye almost\\nfails to detect a flaw in the execution. The spectator may know that he\\nonly stands before a flat surface of paper daubed with paint; but his soul\\nwill be stirred, his pulse begins to beat faster and his imagination runs\\naway with him, as he looks at such masterly executions of a skillful hand\\nas is the \\\"Dead Jesus\\\" and some others in this museum. The congealed blood\\nin his side, upon his hands and on his head, with the tears of Joseph and\\nMary and others, so natural that one mistakes the pictures for the\\nreality, create feelings in the beholder such as he seldom experiences\\nelsewhere, even in Europe. He first mourns for the dead and pities the\\nafflicted; then he recovers himself again, and thanks the artist for\\nhaving given him a key to the thoughts and feelings which he himself must\\nhave cherished while executing this painting. It is said, that when\\nRoubiliac was erecting the Nightingale monument in Westminster Abbey,\\ndescribed on page 86, \\\"he was found one day by Gayfere, the Abbey mason,\\nstanding with his arms folded, and his looks fixed on one of the knightly\\nfigures which support the canopy over the statue of Sir Francis Vere; as\\nGayfere approached, the enthusiastic Frenchman laid his hand on his arm,\\npointed to the figure, and said in a whisper, 'Hush! hush! he vil speak\\npresently.'\\\" Can we conceive that Rubens painted the \\\"Dead Jesus\\\" without\\nsobs and tears?\\n\\nI had seen acres of paintings in the Kensington Museum in London, in the\\nLouvre in Paris and in Palais de Versailles; but it was reserved for me to\\nsee the paintings of Rubens and of Van Dyck last, so that I might know\\ntheir merit.\\n\\nNear the entrance of the Museum, stands a fine monument and statue to the\\nhonor and memory of\\n\\n ANTONIO VAN DYCK\\n P.\\n CIC.ICCCC.LVI.\\n\\nNo one would wish to leave Antwerp without having seen the \\\"gilded halls\\\"\\nby the river side, containing some of the most brilliant apartments in\\nexistence.\\n\\nAntwerp has a population of about 120,000 inhabitants, and is the chief\\nsea-port of Belgium. The Scaut Fleuve (River Scheldt) is from a quarter to\\na third of a mile wide at Antwerp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XI.\\n\\nHolland.\\n\\n\\n\\nEarly on Tuesday morning (August 10th) I started on \\\"a run through\\nHolland.\\\"\\n\\nThe Meuse and the Rhine form numerous mouths, and their deltas are low and\\nmarshy. A most magnificent bridge crosses these, which is several (three?)\\nmiles in length. Fourteen immense iron arches are required to span one of\\nthe mouths of the Rhine. Much of the land is lower than the ocean, and a\\ngreat conflict is waged between the Hollanders and the Sea, for the\\npossession of the land. It is a strange sight to see vessels sail along\\nthe embankments higher than the chimney tops of the houses along the\\nshore! Watchmen are stationed along these embankments and when the ocean\\nbreaks a leak, they will ring the alarm bells and every body will arm\\nhimself with a spade or shovel and run to the sea-shore to battle with the\\nwater. Thus have these people defended their property against the\\nencroachments of the sea for many centuries.\\n\\nA great part of Holland is as level as the ocean, and there are neither\\nfences nor hedges to be seen. But ditches surround every little field and\\nlot, and innumerable wind-mills pump the water that gathers into these\\nditches, up into canals, which intersect the country like a net-work, and\\nconduct the water to the sea. Extensive meadows and rich pasture land\\nsupport large, herds of fine cattle and sheep, which constitute the wealth\\nof Flemish industry.\\n\\nThese Hollanders have some very curious styles of dress, and, like the\\nSwiss, still wear their ancient costumes, even after the rest of Europe\\nhave adopted the fashions of Paris. In the larger towns and cities,\\nhowever, the tide of revolution has set in and the young belles and beaux\\nhave commenced to \\\"sail in Paris styles.\\\" A few years more, and the\\ntraditional costumes of the Flanders will have disappeared altogether.\\n\\nThe men are very partial to \\\"burnsides\\\" and wear their hair pretty long,\\ncombed wet and stroked down so as to look smooth and glossy. The old\\nwomen, in place of ear-rings, wear ornaments in the form of immense\\nspirals suspended from the ends of half of a brass hoop that passes around\\ntheir heads below their white caps. These hang down over the cheeks and\\nare almost as long as their faces. Some of the young ladies coming in from\\nthe rural districts, carry a head rigging--I do not know what else to call\\nit, for it is neither bonnet, hat, nor cap, nor any combination of these;\\nbut it is an apparatus for the head that baffles description, and which,\\nfor want of a better name, we must call a _tremendous thing_, both in\\nmagnitude and in design! I have seen women with straw hats that must have\\nbeen well nigh a yard in diameter! In The Hague, I saw little girls,\\nhowever, (from 6 to 12 or 15 years of age) that were dressed as tidily and\\nlooked as fair and as sweet as any of our American school-girls.\\n\\n\\n\\nPublic Highways.\\n\\n\\nIn Holland, these are _highways_ in fact as well as in name. They run in\\nperfectly strait lines through the country, are about a yard higher than\\nthe meadows at their sides, and are lined by thick rows of willow-trees.\\nThey are turnpiked of course, as are all the roads in civilized Europe.\\nFrom these roads the traveler has always the same field of vision--a\\ncircle around him that is about 8 to 5 miles in diameter. Towering spires\\nmay be seen in all directions. I visited Dordrecht, Rotterdam, The Hague,\\nAmsterdam, Utrecht, Arnheim and intermediate places.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hague,\\n\\n\\nIn Dutch 'S Gravenhage or 'S Hage, in French La Haye, is the capital of\\nHolland as well as one of its finest towns. \\\"It was originally a hunting\\nseat of the Counts of Holland (whence its name, 'S Graven Hage, 'the\\nCount's enclosure').\\\"--_Hurd and Houghton's Satchel Guide to Europe_.\\n\\nThe supreme attraction, is the museum rich im the best paintings of the\\nDutch school. \\\"Here is Paul Potter's world renowned 'Bull,' alone worth, a\\ntrip to Holland to see.\\\" This famous picture represents a rural scene. A\\nram, a ewe, a lamb, a bull and a cow are gathered together under an old\\ntree, and the old farmer, standing somehow behind the tree, taking a look\\nat them. It is so perfectly true to nature that one can hardly persuade\\nhimself that the living animals are not before him. The pictures known as\\nRembrandt's \\\"School of Anatomy\\\" are also as deservedly famous. What ever\\nthe criticism of one who is no artist may be worth, it is my opinion that\\nRubens's paintings and some of those in this museum, are the truest to\\nnature of all that I have seen in Europe. Raphael's paintings in Rome are\\nshady in comparison to those of the Dutch school.\\n\\nTuesday, August 10th, 4:21 p.m. Leave The Hague for Amsterdam, where I\\narrived at 7:30 p.m., having passed Haarlem at 6:45 p.m. At 8 o'clock, as\\nI sat on the platform of the Oosterspoorweg Station, the bells of three\\ndifferent towers commenced simultaneously to chime their peals and that\\ntoo with mathematical precision. The exactness with which the clocks in\\nthe clock-towers of Europe keep time is remarkable; and the music of the\\npealing bells is beautiful, when numbers of them chime at the same time.\\n\\nAt Amsterdam I was asked for my passport, I told the \\\"blue coats\\\" that I\\nhad it in my satchel, \\\"You should have it with you,\\\" said the\\nGerman-speaking official. I replied that I had not been aware of that; and\\nas I had not been asked for it either in England, France or Belgium, I had\\nplaced it into my satchel, so as not to wear it out in my pockets. I sent\\nthe porter to fetch my satchel, took the passport from it, and, after\\nhaving shown it to the officials, placed it into my pocket again, so that\\nI might have it ready in any emergency. These officers were very\\naccommodating to me afterwards, however, during the time that I waited for\\nthe next train for Utrecht. After having had quite a social chat with\\nthem, I asked them what they would have done with me if I could not have\\nproduced them a passport from the government of my country. \\\"Well,\\\" said\\none of them, \\\"we would have been obliged to subject you to an examination,\\nand if your answers would have satisfied the committee, you would have\\nbeen allowed to pass on.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCloak-Rooms.\\n\\n\\nIn connection with the railway stations, wherever I traveled in Europe,\\nthere are \\\"cloak-rooms,\\\" in which the baggage of the travelers is stored\\naway. It costs 1 to 2 cents to have a package, parcel, umbrella or satchel\\ndeposited into one of these, and then the depositor receives a receipt or\\ncheck for his luggage, which he must present when he wishes to have it\\nagain. But Holland offers none of these excellent accommodations, else I\\nwould have spent a day more among these Flanders. When I came to\\nAmsterdam, I was immediately assailed by a herd of porters, each anxious\\nto take my satchel into charge. It had been my rule to carry it to the\\ncloak-room myself, but here I could not find one! After a vehement\\nstruggle with the fierce porters, one of them who could say \\\"Yes,\\\" in\\nGerman, and who nodded his head when I asked him whether he would take it\\nto a cloak-room, took it and carried it into the station, a distance of\\nabout fifty feet. But they kept no cloak-room as I observed when it was\\nnot placed into a special apartment for the purpose. It did not seem\\nhomelike at all to me, so I asked the agent whether he would give me a\\nreceipt for it. \\\"Yes, if you satisfy the porter, I will,\\\" he answered.\\nThis reply made me more tired of Amsterdam than anything else, for,\\nthought I, if the agent of the would-be \\\"cloak-room\\\" is a party to such a\\nset of fellows, I must indeed have fallen into pretty bad company. I\\noffered the porter 4 cents, which was twice as much as it cost me in other\\ncities to have my satchel cared for a whole day, but he refused to take\\nit. Being unwilling to become the victim of their extortions, I took my\\nsatchel and carried it (almost three fourths of a mile) through town to\\nthe Oosterspoorweg on the other side of the city. There I obtained good\\naccommodations. I had asked for lodging while coming through the city, but\\ncould not suit myself; so I decided to start that evening with the first\\ntrain for Utrecht. How different was the social atmosphere of the\\nOosterspoorweg Station! Not only were the porters and the officers civil,\\nbut there was an excellent restaurant connected with it, and the\\nwaiting-girls of the coffee-room were tidily dressed in French costume,\\nspoke German, and were social, polite and accommodating.\\n\\nAt 9:30, I left by train for Utrecht, which I reached at 10:35 p.m. The\\nstation was a new and spacious one and the accommodations were again like\\nthose which I had been accustomed to, before I saw Holland; so I felt\\nquite at home again.\\n\\n\\n\\nUtrecht.\\n\\n\\nIt is entirely wrong for the tourist to come into a strange city late at\\nnight, but I could not avoid it this time on account of my sudden\\ndetermination in Amsterdam not to spend the night there, as had been my\\nintention. A clever and kind-hearted gentleman accompanied me through\\ncomparatively dark streets, and found a good hotel for me.\\n\\nThe next forenoon I ascended the high tower (469 steps, 321 feet in\\nheight). In this tower, at the height of 124 steps, lives the lady\\ncustodian of this stupendous building. She must have \\\"_high_ times\\\" up\\nthere! The tower is a large square structure affording plenty of room even\\nfor several families; but I was thinking that she must have quite a time\\nof it carrying up her water and all the numerous other things necessary to\\nhouse-keeping.\\n\\nThe view from the top of the tower takes in the greater part of Holland.\\nThe country all around is quite level, as far as the eye can see. Level,\\nin Holland, _means_ level. Here one sees the innumerable wind-mills, and\\nthe labyrinthic net-work of canals which intersect Holland. An almost\\nboundless expanse of meadow land stretches out in every direction, and\\naffords excellent pasture to the lowing herds that roam upon it. One sees\\nbut a few scattered trees, and several small woods, all the rest is clear\\nand bear--no hedge-fences even to interrupt the dull monotony of the scene\\nbelow. A strong wind, and it was high too, whistled around that lofty\\ntower, reminding me of our winter storms when they whistle over the\\nchimney-tops--a music that often makes melancholy hearts home-sick.\\n\\nIt was exactly 12:00 o'clock, and I was in the middle of the sentence,\\n\\\"How beautiful these bells chime,\\\" when a boy motioned me to come quickly\\nto a certain place where I could see the cylinder revolve which\\ncommunicates with the peal of bells.\\n\\nTwo points of lightning-rods crown this tower. Few lightning-rods are to\\nbe seen upon private buildings, in Europe, but upon public buildings they\\nare occasionally met with.\\n\\nI must not leave Holland without once more referring to the rattling of\\nthe wooden shoes upon the pavements, the red artificial flowers which old\\ngray-headed women wear upon their heads and the gaudy colors of some of\\ntheir dresses; also to the universal custom of carrying everything upon\\ntheir heads.\\n\\nThe denominations of Dutch money are _florins_ or _guldins,_ and cents;\\n100 cents equal one florin. The florin is equal to 40 cents in United\\nStates money.\\n\\nAt 12:38 p.m., I left by train for Cologne, Germany. By 1:00 o'clock we\\nentered a desolate section of country consisting of barren sandy soil,\\nscanty crops, and dwarfish shrubs and trees. On our way, I formed the\\nacquaintance of an elderly gentleman who moved from Holland to this\\ncountry nineteen years ago. This gentleman explained to me the\\nagricultural institutions of Holland. He now lives in new Holland, Ottowa\\nCo., Michigan, a town of 3,000 inhabitants, most of which are natives of\\nHolland. There are about 15,000 more of his native countrymen living in\\nthe neighborhood of new Holland and at Grand Rapids. They have a newspaper\\npublished in their language in this country. At 2:25 we reached Arnheim\\nwhere my Dutch friend left me.\\n\\nAt Zeevenaar (near the boundary between Holland and Germany) we passed\\nmuster. Soon after we crossed the Rhine on a ferry, which carried us and\\nthe whole trains of cars over together. Thence we rode through Rhenish\\nPrussia on, on, until we reached Cologne.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XII.\\n\\nCologne.\\n\\n\\n\\nK\\u00f6ln, (or Cologne), the principal town in the Rhenish Province of Prussia,\\nthe seat of the supreme court of justice for the west bank of the Rhine,\\none of the chief commercial cities in Germany, and a military stronghold\\nof the first class, is an old Catholic city dating its foundation from the\\n1st century of the Christian era. In the beginning of the present century,\\nit had 200 churches and chapels; it has at present 25 only, two of which\\nare prodestant.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Cathedral.\\n\\n\\nThe first place that the traveler naturally goes to visit is the\\nCathedral, (Ger. Dom), which \\\"is perhaps\\\" says B\\u00e6deker, \\\"the most\\nmagnificent Gothic edifice in the world.\\\" This superb edifice is over an\\nacre and a half in extent! It is 448 feet long and 249 feet through the\\ntransepts; the choir is 149 feet high. The magnificent south portal cost\\nmore than $500,000.\\n\\nThe central portal in the west end is 93 feet high, and 31 feet wide. The\\ncentral window is 48 feet in height and 20 feet wide. The projected height\\nof the twin towers is 511 feet. These are intended to consist of four\\nstories, the third of which is approaching completion. A model\\nrepresenting in miniature what this structure is intended to be in the\\nheight of its glory when its towers are completed and crowned with spires,\\nmay be seen in a store adjacent to the _Dom-platz,_ where the \\\"only\\nveritable\\\" Cologne water (eau de Cologne) may also be obtained.\\n\\nThe foundation of this vast edifice was laid in 1248. Little work was done\\nat it between 1322 and the beginning of the 16th century, and none from\\nthe latter date until 1816, when its restoration was begun under the\\nauspices of the King of Prussia. Since that time $2,000,000 have been\\nexpended upon it. Those lower portions of the walls which were built 600\\nyears ago, are old and gray and washed thinner by the rains of those half\\na dozen centuries. Such as appreciate the poetry of architecture, see in\\nits multitude of spires and finials (large and small) a thousand vegetable\\nforms, uniting to produce a bewildering effect upon the imagination; but\\nno word-picture can do justice to the almost matchless beauty of this fine\\nblossom of Gothic architecture. The tourist will love to go round about it\\nand inspect and contemplate its every part, to take near views and distant\\nviews of it, and to revisit it time and again; and when he has bid adieu\\nto Cologne and returned to his far distant home, he will dream dreams, by\\nday and by night, in which he revisits and beholds again the beauties and\\nglories of this magnificent temple.\\n\\n_St. Ursula,_ a church that is said to have been been built in the 11th\\ncentury, contains a monument erected (1658) to St. Ursula, a princess of\\nEngland, who, according to the legend, when on her return from a\\npilgrimage to Rome, was barbarously murdered by the Huns at Cologne with\\nher 11,000 virgin attendants. The skulls and bones of these martyrs are\\npreserved in cases placed round the church. Large sections of the walls in\\nthe church are shelved and divided into pigeon holes, each containing a\\nskull! I saw no less than 600 or 700 of these skulls (by actual count).\\nThe bones \\\"are worked into the walls in a species of sepulchral mosaic.\\\"\\nThese bones, it is said, had been in their graves about 400 years. The old\\npictures of the apostles are painted upon slates, one of them bearing the\\ndate 1224.\\n\\nIn the Golden Chamber are preserved the most sacred relics; here is a bone\\nwhich is claimed to have been in the right arm of St. Ursula, while a\\ngilded shrine contains the rest of her bones. Do these identifications not\\nprove conclusively that anatomy was better understood when these bones\\nwere classified than it is even now? The name of the anatomist who\\nselected St. Ursula's bones from among 11,000 and identified them is not\\ngiven, but he certainly deserves much credit for it. Here are thorns from\\nthe crown and a piece of the rod with which Christ was scorged, one of the\\nsix jars of alabaster used at the marriage in Galilee, and a piece, about\\nas thick as a hair and an inch or two long, of the \\\"true cross.\\\" So they\\n_say_. These things were brought hither from Syria by the crusaders in\\n1378.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Museum.\\n\\n\\nThe Museum in Cologne is one of the most interesting that I have yet seen.\\nIts curious old paintings carry one back to the wretched times of the\\nmiddle ages, when nothing but superstition and the night-mare of hell\\ncould influence predatory man to humanity on civil order. A picture of the\\nLast Judgement is characteristic of the religious notions of those early\\ntimes. In this, Christ is represented as sitting on one rainbow and\\nresting his feet upon another. To his right stands a beautiful castle,\\ninto which numbers of beautiful persons are going. But on the left, how\\nhorrible! A massive time-worn citadel from whose large chimney tower issue\\nflames and smoke, into which winged devils are descending, while others,\\ncarrying wretched-looking men in their clutches, fly about near it, or are\\napproaching it with their struggling victims, and hideous monsters of\\nquaint, fantastic forms accompany them in their excursions! One of these\\nhideous beasts is represented with an extra head upon one shoulder and one\\nunder its breast; it has also faces upon its knees!\\n\\nAmong the other relics of antiquity, is Cheopetra with a little snake\\ncreeping over her bosom, Christ on the Cross surrounded by Mary and the\\nApostles, Madonna in an arbor of roses, Lions Fighting, Mourning Jews,\\nSummer Night on the Rhine, and Galileo in Prison, deserve special notice\\namong the hundreds of other admirable paintings.\\n\\nA fine iron bridge 1,359 feet long, and wide enough for a double line of\\nrails and a separate roadway, crosses the Rhine directly east of the\\nCathedral.\\n\\nIn traveling through foreign lands, one sees so much that is indecent,\\nobscene, and shockingly profane, according to his our way of thinking,\\nthat he scarcely knows what to include and what to suppress in his\\naccounts of foreign manners, customs and institutions. Some writers\\nincline to the policy of rendering a true account of what they touch, but\\nwill restrain their pens from giving any notice of about one fourth of all\\nthey see, because they do not wish to pain the feelings of their readers\\nby reciting to them narrations of horrible tragedies that occurred in the\\npast, or of groveling superstitions that prevailed; such as we all wish\\nhad never disgraced the history of infant humanity or constituted the\\nday-dreams of our ancestors. They carefully select that which flatters and\\npleases the vanity of their fellows, and pass by unnoticed, everything\\nelse. This course may tickle vain people, but it cannot meet with favor\\namong those who love the truth, and the whole truth. There are sins of\\n_omission_ as well as of _commission,_ and writers betray and deceive the\\nworld as much by the former class as by the latter. Some fastidious\\nwriters are afraid to call things by their proper names, considering it\\nmore appropriate to paint an African with a brownish color than to shock\\nthe beholder with a picture of a man with a _black_ face! I can not take\\nthe reader through Europe in that way. To paint a negro we need _black_\\npaint, and to describe scenes which are unfamiliar we need words and\\nlanguage that is not used in the drawing room or parlor every time we\\nmeet. So much for the introduction to an episode that is characteristic of\\nthe profanity of some of the descendents of the old Teutonic stock, when\\nthey become exasperated. The second day that I spent in Cologne, I went to\\na German barber to be put into trim for making my descend into the lower\\nlatitudes and consequently warmer countries. Another customer was ahead of\\nme. While the barber was at work upon him, all the time in a rage and\\nswearing _barber_ously at some proceedings, a thunder storm came up very\\nsuddenly, and so obscured the light of the sun (though it was midday) that\\nhe could not see to go on with his work. Hereupon he began first to swear\\nat the clouds, then at the Lord himself, using all the epithets of abuse\\nthat he could find in his entire vocabulary of profanity, there were heavy\\npeals of thunder and vivid flashes of lightning, but, the darker it became\\nand the more tremendous the crashes of the thunderbolts, the more the\\nsenseless and exasperated barber cursed and swore. After the shower and\\nhail, I walked out into the pure fresh air and under the blue vault of\\nheaven smiling down upon the refreshed vegetation, and tried to draw a\\npicture of that profane man's mental panorama, but I never succeeded even\\nto this day. Such behavior is not of rare occurrence, else I should not\\nhave related it; but even sacred history refers to similar incidents. The\\nwicked, it is recorded, danced and were merry even until the waters of the\\nflood swept them away.\\n\\nA certain divine related to me a similar story concerning the behavior of\\na large body of the passengers with him on the \\\"Great Eastern,\\\" when she\\nwas foundered at sea and obliged to return, after they had advanced 500\\nmiles. When the storm was assailing the great ship, breaking down its\\nmasts and tearing away its rigging, so that most of the passengers were in\\ndespair and expected to sink any hour, they kept prayer-meetings almost\\ncontinually. Another faction found fault with these, declared that praying\\nwas an intolerable nuisance and asked the Captain to prohibit it. The\\nCaptain decided that he would not interfere, whereupon the party offended\\ntook to dancing, cursing and swearing, and tried their utmost in this way\\nto break up the prayer-meetings,\\n\\nI heard similar profanity on my return trip across the Atlantic. One night\\nwhen a storm assailed our ship, so that the waves rolled over the deck and\\nthe fierce rocking of the vessel threw many almost out of their beds, I\\nheard many of them swear, even during the very time that the thunder\\nrolled with tremendous roarings and crashes across the heavens. It seems\\nalmost impossible that conscious intelligent beings could behave thus, but\\nthe fact that they do, helps us to believe other strange truths recorded\\nin history, without which, no correct conception of man's former depraved\\ncondition can be formed at this advanced day. For example, few seem to\\nappreciate the part played by the Catholic Church with her images,\\nshrines, sacred relics, paid magnificent temples, in taming and civilizing\\nman, because they do not know who and what he was when the light of\\nintelligence first began to direct his footsteps, and he had not yet\\nlearned to control his selfish nature which had hitherto been guided by an\\ninstinct worth a hundred times more than intelligence without morality or\\nreligion. We make a sad mistake yet in the nineteenth century, in\\ncultivating the intellect and leaving morality so much out of the\\nquestion. We see some of the fruits already in the corruption which\\nprevails alike in all circles without regard to party or sect. I will\\nrecur to this again in speaking of the influence of the church, when I\\ncome to describe the magnificent churches of Italy.\\n\\nOn the second afternoon that I spent at Cologne there had been a shower,\\nand from sunset till dusk I beheld one of the grandest atmospheric\\nphenomena that I had ever witnessed. From a window of Ml\\u00fcler's Hotel\\n(facing the _Dom-Platz_) I was looking over the Cathedral at the western\\nsky, as the sun throw its colored light through the small drops of rain\\nstill descending, and thus colored both the green foliage of the trees and\\nthe grand edifice before me, presenting a scene of such enchanting beauty\\nas would afford almost a sufficient excuse for one to go into raptures, or\\nsink down in a fit of ecstatic delight.\\n\\nI may add that before leaving Cologne, I saw among the many dog-teams used\\nin distributing produce over the city, a span whose disproportion I shall\\nnever forget; there was a dog hitched to one side of the shaft and a woman\\ntook hold of the other side and assisted him in pulling the load!\\n\\n\\n\\nBonn.\\n\\n\\nOn Friday morning, August 13th, I left Cologne and went by rail to Bonn,\\n21 miles further up the Rhine. It is the seat of the Freidrich Wilhelm\\nUniversity, and contains about 26,000 inhabitants. The Poppelsdorfer\\nAllee, an excellent quadruple avenue of fine horse-chestnuts, three\\nquarters of a mile long, is the principal promenade of the town. At the\\nend of it stands the Schloss containing the University, with a library\\n(200,000 volumes) and a museum rich in Roman antiquities. The M\\u00fcnster (or\\nCathedral) dates from the 12th and 13th centuries. In the M\\u00fcnsterplatz\\nstands a fine bronze statue of Beethoven, a celebrated German musician,\\nwho was born in the Bonngasse, No. 515. This statue faces south, (as do\\nmost of the statues that I have seen in Europe, except when the\\nsurroundings are unfavorable). One side of the pedestal contains the\\nfollowing inscription:\\n\\n LUDWIG\\n VAN\\n BEETHOVEN\\nGeb. zu Bonn MDCCLXX.\\n\\nThe other three sides contain base reliefs representing muses playing upon\\nmusical instruments.\\n\\nHalf a mile above the Poppelsdorfer Schloss rises the Kreuzberg (400 feet\\nhigh) crowned with a white church. This contains the \\\"Holy Steps\\\" 28 in\\nnumber, which must only be ascended on the knees, and are in imitation of\\nthe Scala Sancta at the Lateran in Rome, piously believed to be the\\nidentical steps of the Pr\\u00e6torium ascended by the Savior when he appeared\\nbefore Pilate.\\n\\nThe view from the tower of this church is one of the most beautiful on the\\nRhine. After enjoying the scenery a while, with a party of ladies and\\ngentlemen whose society I had joined in the church below, we came down,\\nand I took a rustic seat on an eminence and surveyed the beauties of the\\nlandscape more at leisure. The most beautiful part of the Rhine is from\\nBonn to Mayence, and this view from the Kreuzberg constituted for me a\\nfine initiation into the charming scenery that fell to my portion to enjoy\\nthe coming three days. Large sections of the country here are entirely\\nwithout fences, there being no hedge-fences even, and the landscape\\ncheckered by the different fresh colors of the various crops, spreads out\\nlike a beautiful carpet of green, red, yellow, gray, and a dozen other\\ntints and shakes, all mixed up, or like a pavement rich in mosaics. We had\\nalso gone into the cellar of the church to see the skeletons and bodies of\\n26 _Servitten_ lying about in boxes or coffins set in rows upon the\\nground. These, it is said, built the church in 1627. The bodies of several\\nof them seem to have petrified more or less perfectly, but the rest of\\nthem are mere skeletons, and present an anatomical display that reminded\\nme of what I had seen in St. Ursula, in Cologne, as above described. This\\ncellar is perfectly dark and is entered by a trap-door in the form of a\\nheavy stone, which an attendant removes by means of a crow-bar. The steps\\nleading down are narrow and the passage very low, so that several of the\\nladies at first declined to enter, but we persuaded them, however, to\\naccompany us. A tallow candle afforded us some little light, and after\\nbrushing away the cobwebs which the spiders had spun since the last party\\nhad made their entry, we came upon the sickening sight of the dozen or\\nmore skeletons still preserved. The ladies in the party were intelligent\\nand dressed tastefully, and I shall never forget how the gaudy colors of\\ntheir dresses contrasted with the gloom of that nasty cellar.\\n\\nThe frequent odd adventures into such places as many would not like to\\nenter in their own homes in the presence of their friends and companions,\\nconstitutes a prolific source of amusement. After we had crept out of that\\ndirty cobwebbed passage, our clothes were slightly soiled and cobwebby.\\nWith the remark, \\\"If we were all with our fashionable circles at home, I\\nsuppose we should not go on this way,\\\" or some such allusion, that reminds\\nthe company of how differently they are wont to go on at home,-one can,\\nunder such circumstances generally provoke a fit of merriment. To the\\ntraveler, every day is a day of adventures--frequently of rather funny\\nadventures!\\n\\nAt 2:30 p.m., I left Bonn by rail for Mehlen, (5 miles further up), where\\nI crossed the Rhine on a ferry and came to K\\u00f6nigswinter on its right bank.\\nSoutheast of this village lie \\\"The Seven Mountains\\\" (Siebengebirge). From\\nthe Drachenfels (1,066 feet high) the view is the most picturesque, and\\nthis one, about a mile from the village, I ascended. Donkeys and donkey\\nboys are found here in aboundance, but I would have nothing to do with the\\ndonkey, and immediately set out to make the ascent on foot. I did not come\\nfar before a girl crowned me, with a wreath made of leaves, and asked me\\nto buy it. The scenery is so romantic, here, that many will yield to the\\nimportunities of these poor girls and give them a _groschen_ (2\\u00bd cents)\\nand make the rest of their journeys with wreaths of leaves upon their\\nhats! The ruins of the castle of Drachenfels (or dragon's rock) erected in\\nthe beginning of the 12th century, is near the summit of the peak. The\\ncavern of the dragon may be seen from the Rhine half way up the hill.\\n\\\"This dragon was slain by Sigfried, the hero from the Low Countries, who,\\nhaving bathed himself in its blood, became invulnerable.\\\"\\n\\nThe summit of Drachenfels commands one of the noblest prospects of the\\nRhine. Here sat Byron when he wrote the following beautiful lines:\\n\\n \\\"The castled crag of Drachenfels\\n Frowns o'er the wide and winding Rhine,\\n Whose breast of waters broadly swells\\n Between the banks which hear the vine;\\n And hills all rich with blossomed trees,\\n And fields which promise corn and wine\\n And scattered cities crowning these,\\n Whose far white walls along them shine,\\n Have strew'd a scene which I should see\\n With double joy went _thou_ with me.\\\"\\n\\nWhile luxuriating here amidst these grand and beautiful scenes of the\\nRhine, we were visited, by a shower, after which I enjoyed the sublime\\nsight of _looking down upon a rainbow_ which stood in the valley below me!\\n\\nThat evening I rode by rail to Ehrenbreitstein which is opposite to\\nCoblentz.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIII.\\n\\nCoblentz.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Saturday afternoon, August 14th, I prepared a programme of my\\ncontemplated trip through South Germany, Switzerland, Italy and the East,\\nwhich, together with several hundred cards, I got printed in the\\nafternoon. By means of these programmes I informed my correspondents in\\nAmerica, in which cities I would look for mail matter and at what times I\\nexpected to reach them.\\n\\nMr. Elmer, of the _Coblentzer Volkszeitung_, told me that the dialects of\\nthe German language are so different, that the people of Coblentz and\\nthose of Cologne can scarcely understand each other when they speak their\\npeculiar dialects.\\n\\nThe principle, that whenever a stream of water makes a curve, the outside\\nbank (that which turns the water from its strait course) is always more\\nprecipitous than the other in proportion to the amount of curvature of the\\nstream, is well illustrated at the confluence of the Mosel and the Rhine\\nat Coblentz, by the course of the latter. The waters of the Mosel flow\\nalmost perpendicularly against the right bank of the Rhine, and have\\nhelped it in forming the precipitous rock of Ehrenbreitstein rising to the\\nheight of 387 feet above the river, upon which stand the famous\\nfortifications of that name. The Rhine curves toward the left for about\\nsix or eight miles, and its right bank is in consequence high and steep,\\nwhile the left bank is in the form of a gradual slope, bearing a striking\\nresemblance to the valley of the Jordan for a mile around Siegersville,\\nLehigh Co., Pa. Another principle, that the width of a valley and the\\nhardness of its bed is always in proportion to the fall of the stream of\\nwater flowing through it, does also find as ample illustrations in the\\nsweeping Rhine as in any of the humbler streams whose courses I had\\nwatched and studied at home. These two principles afford perhaps the\\nstrongest and most conclusive of all proofs, that the hills and valleys of\\nour planet are all the result of erosion.\\n\\nThe streets of Coblentz are mostly narrow, as are also its pavements, many\\nof the latter being only from one to two feet wide. There are several\\nremarkable churches, one, the Church of St. Castor dating from 1208, being\\nan example of the early \\\"Lombard style.\\\"\\n\\nIn order to enjoy the Rhine scenery to the greatest advantage, I took\\npassage on a steamer to Bingen, and started out on Sunday morning at 10\\no'clock. One of the steamers had been delayed about three hours that\\nmorning on account of the fog, but the day turned out to be a most\\nbeautiful one. I took a seat near the prow of the steamer, where I could\\nconveniently watch the views of both banks without interruption from any\\nsource. I was now about to ascend the most romantic part of the\\nRhine--the Rhine of history and of poetry, upon whose precipitous banks\\nthe Germans erected their castles in the early and middle ages and\\ndefended their \\\"Fatherland\\\" against the attacks of their warlike\\nneighbors. Only after one has seen the castled steam with its numerous\\nwatch-towers crowning every towering peak, and the indescribable beauties\\nof this noble river, will the national air, \\\"Die Wacht Am Rhein,\\\" (Watch\\nAt The Rhine), seem so beautiful to him, as it does to the sons of\\nGermany, whose souls are stirred by its boundless historic associations.\\n\\nI cannot stop to describe the scores of Schl\\u00f6sser, (castles), the charming\\nprospects, the beautiful valleys with their verdant hillsides peeping into\\nthe Rhine, and the rich vineyards upon its sloping banks in some places,\\nor the romantic scenery of the bare rocky mountains that rise almost\\nperpendicularly at its sides to the height of 300 to 500 feet, in other\\nplaces. Several objects claim particular attention, however.\\n\\nSome 35 or 40 miles up the river from Coblentz, on the left bank, rise the\\nimposing rocks of the Lurlei to the height of 433 feet above the Rhine.\\nThe river is very narrow in this place, has much fall and makes a decided\\nturn, so that it is with considerable difficulty and some danger that\\nsteamers make their ascent. The river is here 76 feet deep and its waters\\nform a whirlpool, (Gewirre). This place and every other one of interest\\nalong the Rhine, as well as all its castles, have their legends. It is\\nsaid that a siren who had her abode on the rock, was wont by means of\\ncharming music to entice sailors and fishermen to their destruction in the\\nrapids at the foot of the precipice.\\n\\nAs it is dangerous for steamers to meet on these rapids, they have a rule\\nthat every steamer coming up the stream must fire a few small cannons as\\nsoon as it approaches the Lurlei, so that steamers that are descending may\\nhear it and wait to let the ascending steamer pass before they enter upon\\nthe rapids.\\n\\nNear Bingen is the Mouse Tower, so called because the cruel Archbishop\\nHatto, of Mayence? had once compared some poor famishing people to mice\\nbent on devouring corn, and caused them to be burned in his barn after\\nhaving invited them to come there and receive provisions which it had been\\nhis duty to give them. After this outrage he was immediately attacked by\\nmice, which tormented him day and night. He sought refuge in this tower,\\nbut was followed by his persecutors and soon devoured alive. Thus runs the\\nlegend.\\n\\nWe reached Bingen at 3:30 p.m., and started by rail for Frankfort on the\\nMain an hour later. At 7:15 we crossed the Rhine by the magnificent iron\\nbridge at Mayence, from which we had a good view of the extensive\\nfortifications of that city, also the rich decorations of the entire city\\nwith banners, for, though it was Sunday, the Republicans (Internationals\\nor Communists as they call themselves) had a great political meeting. I\\nformed the acquaintance of one of their number who traveled with me to\\nFrankfort and gave me an invitation to accompany him to one of their\\nmeetings the next evening. The Communists which fled from Paris after the\\nstorm of 1871, are now busy in different countries assisting those opposed\\nto royalty to form organizations for the purpose of instituting other\\nrevolutionary movements some future day.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrankfort.\\n\\n\\nFrankfort, the home of the Rothschilds, down to 1866 a free city of the\\nGerman Confederation and the seat of the Diet, has a population of 90,000\\ninhabitants. It has 20,000 Catholics and 8,000 Jews.\\n\\nThe R\\u00f6mer is historically the most interesting building in Frankfort. It\\nbecame the town-hall in 1405. In the second story is the Kaisersaal\\n(Imperial Hall) containing the portraits of 47 emperors reigning from A.D.\\n912 to 1806. In front of it is the R\\u00f6merberg, (a large square), or\\nmarket-place, which was the scene of public rejoicings on the occasion of\\nthe election of an emperor. After dining in the Kaisersaal he would show\\nhimself from the balcony to the assembled multitudes upon it. Down to the\\nend of the last century no Jew was permitted to enter it.\\n\\nThe Judengasse (or Jew's street) was founded in 1462 and until the\\nbeginning of the present century all the Jews of the city lived there in\\nan isolated community. Every evening and on Sundays and holidays, this\\nstreet was closed with gates, and a Jew who would venture into any part of\\nthe town was subject to a heavy penalty.\\n\\nThe Church of St. Paul is immediately behind the R\\u00f6mer. It is a circular\\nbuilding having seating capacity for 3,000 adults, and was used in 1848-9\\nfor the meetings of the \\\"German National Assembly for remodeling the\\nConstitution.\\\"\\n\\nFrankfort is the birthplace of Goethe, and has embellished one of its\\nsquares with a fine monument to his memory. It has also a fine monument to\\nSchiller and a magnificent one to Gutenberg.\\n\\nIn some of the old streets of this city the upper stories of the houses\\nare built out over the streets, making a break in the wall at every story,\\nso that some of the narrow streets are thus almost arched over.\\n\\nI left Frankfort by rail on the 17th of August, at 2:00 o'clock, and\\nreached Darmstadt at 2:40 p.m.\\n\\nBefore leaving home, I had been presented by different persons with the\\naddresses of a number of their friends and acquaintances in different\\ncountries of Europe, and also with letters of introduction to them. On\\naccount of my unbounded success in forming congenial friendships with\\nforeigners, I never departed from my programme in order to meet persons\\nfor whom I carried letters, and consequently met none of them except a\\nyoung American lady who had been abroad for several years with the object\\nof studying the German language, and who was now connected with an\\neducational institution at Darmstadt. Though I had been almost continually\\nsurrounded by tourists whose society and friendship I enjoyed and\\nappreciated, still this meeting with a friend of one of my friends at\\nhome, seemed to me just like meeting an old acquaintance. We seated\\nourselves under a tree in the beautiful garden belonging to the Boarding\\nSchool, and had a long talk about what each had seen in Europe, and how\\nthe social, political and literary institution of the Old World differ\\nfrom those of America. The next day my new friend kindly accompanied me\\nthrough the large museum contained in the Schloss, comprising a valuable\\ncollection of about 700 paintings, among them some fine specimens of the\\nDutch school. The Library in the Schloss consists of 450,000 volumes. On\\nour way to the Schloss Garden we saw a little hut nestled in the garrets\\nof other large buildings and surrounded by them on every side, except one\\nof its gable-ends. The old peasant (so says tradition) would not part with\\nit for any price, therefore his neighbors built their houses _around_,\\n_beneath_ and _over_ his, leaving but _one_ side clear through which he\\ncould admit the light of heaven into his humble apartment! Darmstadt has\\nabout 40,000 inhabitants, and is one of the cleanest and most modern in\\nappearance of all the cities that I met in the Old World. Its broad and\\nshaded streets intersecting each other at right angles, give it much of\\nthe appearance of an American city. The view from the Ludwigs\\u00e4ule commands\\na fine prospect of the level country around, with its large woods of \\\"tall\\ntrees\\\" so rare in Europe, and the Rhein Strasse (Rhine Street) loosing\\nitself only in the distance, is the straitest and longest street that I\\nhave yet seen.\\n\\n\\n\\nWorms.\\n\\n\\nWorms is one of the oldest towns in Germany. \\\"The war against the Saxons\\nwas planned here in, 772, and here the great contest concerning the\\ninvesture of the bishops with ring and staff was adjusted by the Concordat\\nbetween, the Emp. Henry V. and Pope Calixtus II.\\\" It had once 70,000\\ninhabitants, but it contains now only 15,000, (2/3 Prodestant).\\n\\nThe _Cathedral_ is a remarkably fine Romanesque edifice with four elegant\\ntowers, and two domes. The towers are adorned with odd figures of animals\\nand gurgoyles. Most of this church dates from the 12th century. In the\\npediment is \\\"the figure of a woman with a mural crown, mounted on an\\nanimal, whose four heads (angel, lion, ox, eagle,) are symbols of the four\\nEvangelists, the whole being emblematic of the victorious church.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In the Bishofshof was held the diet of April 1521, in which Luther\\ndefended his doctrines in the presence of Charles V., six electors, and a\\nnumerous assembly, concluding with the words: 'Here I stand, I cannot act\\notherwise, God help me! Amen.'\\\"\\n\\nThe Baptistry contains some curious sculptures. Upon the roof of the\\nbuilding (stable) represented in connection with the Nativity, there lies\\na wheel, the signification of which no one could tell me. Among other\\nmusical instruments represented in relief in this church, there are the\\nharp, the bugle and rows of violins or fiddles!\\n\\nIn the Luther-Platz stands the great Luther Monument, an imposing memorial\\nof the Great Reformer. Its execution occupied nine years and cost $85,000.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIV.\\n\\nDie Pfalz (Palatinate).\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom Worms I went to Frankenthal, where I spent the night (of August 18th)\\nat the Pfalzhof. It was now nearly two months since I had left America,\\nand since that time, in all my wanderings, I had met no people that\\nresembled the Americans. Even in Germany had I not yet seen any one whose\\nphysiognomy spoke of near kinship to any that I knew on the other side of\\nthe Atlantic. But at\\n\\n\\n\\nFrankenthal\\n\\n\\nI was introduced to a new class of experiences which were as unexpected as\\nthey were pleasant. If I had not here experienced it, I could never have\\nanticipated the feelings of a lonely wanderer who, when thousands of miles\\naway from home, was addressed in tones so like unto the voices of those he\\nloved to hear at home, that he felt as if he was all the time hearing\\nfamiliar voices in every direction.\\n\\nAt Worms my attention had already been arrested by social phases that\\nreminded me of America, but at Frankenthal I met an officer at the\\nstation, who, upon being asked where the peculiar Palatinate dialect was\\nspoken, not only mentioned to me the places, but also gave me a list of\\nPf\\u00e4lzish words that are peculiar to them, most of which are purely\\nPennsylvania German both in their pronunciation and their meanings. A\\nyoung girl at the hotel and her brother not only used language similar to\\nours, but betrayed their kinship in various other ways. I spent about a\\nweek in Mannheim, Neustadt, Speyer and the surrounding country, during\\nwhich time I devoted all my attention to the question of our common\\nancestry. That those people are cousins to many of our Pennsylvania\\nGermans can easily be proved in a variety of ways, even when we throw\\naside the traditional and historic evidences which we have that many\\nPennsylvanians have emigrated from the Pfalz in times past. The most\\nconvincing proof to those who can not go there and see the people\\nthemselves, likely consists in the fact that many of the family names of\\nthe Pf\\u00e4lzer and of our Pennsylvania Germans are the same. I attended the\\nlarge annual S\\u00e4ngerfest at Neustadt, in which 973 singers from all parts\\nof the Pfalz participated. I procured a catalogue of their names and found\\nthat a very large proportion are the same as those of the majority of our\\npeople. When we contrast with this the fact that the proportion of names\\ncommon between our people and that of any other section, is much smaller,\\nwe see the force of the argument. But this is by no means the first thing\\nthat strikes the visitor. Consanguinity or relationship by blood betrays\\nitself in a hundred ways. Particular words and expressions, peculiar\\npitches of the voice, styles of address, forms of salutations, and special\\nways of performing certain kinds of work, tell their tale with an emphasis\\nthat makes itself understood even to the unscientific observer. The\\nexpression of the face and the very ring of the laugh often impressed me\\nwith the truth that it was that of a cousin's brother or sister. I often\\nexpressed my surprise at these things to those around me, and by a free\\nindulgence in the peculiarities of their idiom enlisted the attention and\\ngained the friendship of those people with magical effect. From\\nFrankenthal I went to\\n\\n\\n\\nMannheim,\\n\\n\\nwhich is the most regularly built town in Germany. It is divided into 100\\nsquares like a chess-board, and has about 40,000 inhabitants. It consists\\nof 20 sections lettered from A to U (the J being excluded from the\\nnomenclature) and the squares of each sections numbered from 1 to 5. As\\nthe city enlarges in territory the numbers of the squares run from 5\\nupwards. The streets are named as in other cities, but the houses are\\nnumbered _around_ the squares. Thus the _Mannheimer Familienblatter_ (a\\nnewspaper published in the Pf\\u00e4lzisch dialect, which is like the\\nPennsylvania German) is printed at E 1. 8.--Section E, Square 1, No. 8.\\n\\n\\n\\nNeustadt.\\n\\n\\nAt Neustadt I made my home for half a week whence I took excursions into\\nthe country. One day I went to Drachenfels, walking about 16 miles in the\\nwoods, where I had nothing but paths and guide-boards to lead me; but the\\nlatter are found wherever two paths meet, so that I could easily find my\\nway back again. In order to meet these people in every sphere of life, I\\nused to go out to see the poor men and women work in the fields. One\\nSaturday afternoon I struck out from Landau toward the Haardt Mountains\\nwith a view to put up for the night in a certain town that I saw on a\\ndistant hill. When I had come a short distance, I overtook a little maiden\\nwhom I asked the name of that town, so that I might ask the way thither if\\nI should come into a valley where I could not have pointed it out any\\nlonger. I pleased the young girl very much by presenting her with my card,\\nand induced her to use her glib tongue volubly in telling me about their\\nschools--what they studied, how long the terms last, &c. She would get\\nalong very well in our Pennsylvania German dialect. When we parted, she\\nskipped away and proudly showed the card which she had received from an\\n\\\"American,\\\" to one of her schoolmates (?). Here one may see women hauling\\nhay and grain with cows, though I also saw some men use horses. Toward\\nevening I met a peasant of B\\u00f6chingen, who had finished his work and was\\nabout to return home. On learning that I was an American, he asked me to\\naccompany him to his village, saying that _Kirmes_ had come, the great\\njubilee season of the year when all the churches were being re-dedicated,\\nafter which ceremony the people would go to the public houses and keep up\\ndancing and drinking wine and beer from Sunday noon till Monday night, and\\nthat I could therefore see a great many Palatinates together in his town I\\nasked him what hotel accommodations their town had; to which he replied\\nthat there were several hotels and he would conduct me to a good one. On\\nreaching the place I accompanied him first to his home and was introduced\\nto his family. I had here one of those opportunities, so rare to the\\ntraveler, of seeing the kitchen arrangements of the middle and lower\\nclasses. When we came to the hotel he asked the landlord for a room for\\nme, who immediately came to me and explained that on account of the great\\n\\\"Fest\\\" (anniversary) he had turned all the spare rooms of the house into\\ncoffee-rooms, \\\"but,\\\" said he, \\\"though I know that Americans are used to\\ngood accommodations, I can only offer you the _Fruchtkammer_ (granery)\\nto-night, where I have a good nice bed for you, however, if that will suit\\nyou.\\\" The homelike cheerful tone and conversation of the landlord at once\\ncaptivated me, and when I looked at the large house and saw all his rooms\\nalready filled with guests enjoying their wine and beer together, after\\nthe German fashion, I soon decided to stay with them. The room which he\\ngave me was a very large one in the second story of the house, and,\\nthough there were large heaps of grain and different kinds of farming\\nimplements there, the end where the bed stood was clean and inviting,\\nconsidering the circumstances. There was no lock at the door, but the\\nlandlord's honest face and assurances soon put me at ease about that\\nmatter. He told me that I might place some barrels against it, however, if\\nI felt so inclined, which of course I did. There was a lady in that town\\nwho had been spending her time in Philadelphia for several years, but who\\nhad on this occasion come home to B\\u00f6chingen on a visit. An invitation was\\nsent to her in the evening already, asking her to come to the hotel where\\nan American was waiting to meet her, and early on Sunday morning she met\\nme in the coffee-room where we spent the morning. One's partiality to the\\nEnglish language seldom displeased me in Europe, but as this lady was a\\nnative of that part of the Pfalz whose people spoke a dialect more like\\nthe Pennsylvania German than I heard anywhere else, I insisted upon\\nconversing with her in \\\"the dialect.\\\" The landlord who did not understand\\nany English was with us most of the time, so that out of respect for him\\nshe also felt constrained to speak German when he was present, but\\nwhenever he left us she would speak English, the language of her new\\nAmerican home. She had visited Allentown, Pa., and was well acquainted\\nwith the resemblance of the Pf\\u00e4lzish and the Pennsylvania German\\ndialects. I went home to Neustadt that forenoon and attended the great\\nPf\\u00e4lzer S\\u00e4ngerfest (the annual Concert of the Palatinate Choirs). The city\\nwas splendidly decorated with flags, and the \\\"Fest\\\" was a grand success in\\nevery respect. From Neustadt I went to Speyer, and a day later to\\n\\n\\n\\nHeidelberg.\\n\\n\\nHeidelberg was the only place where I found lady ticket agents at the\\nrailway station. The station is a very large and important one, and the\\npositions held by those ladies are of great responsibility. In Continental\\nEurope, it is the ladies that transact most of the business in almost\\nevery city. Hotels, stores, shops, cafes, drinking stands, &c., are\\ngenerally managed by ladies.\\n\\nHeidelberg was the last city in which I felt that I was hourly seeing the\\ncousins of the Pennsylvania Germans. Here still, I did occasionally see\\none who not only favored some of our people in form and features, but\\nwhose voice and accent also spoke of kinship. I had heard persons speak in\\nsome parts of the Pfalz and particularly around B\\u00f6chingen (about 10 miles\\nS.S.W. from Neustadt and 25 miles W.S.W. from Speyer) from 50 to 70 per\\ncent of whose words corresponded to the Pennsylvania German. D\\u00fcrkheim,\\nLandau, (and some say, Kaiserslautern too), are good examples.\\n\\nThe old renowned university of Heidelberg has 800 students, and a library\\nof 200,000 volumes and 1,800 MSS.\\n\\nThe castle is the most magnificent ruin in Germany. The towers, turrets,\\nbuttresses, balconies, and fine statues still stand there, proud and bold,\\neven in its ruins. And the portcullis of iron in one of its lofty gateways\\ngave me the first idea how the balance of the enemy could be shut off,\\nafter a portion had been admitted into the yard of the fortifications with\\na view of slaughtering them. The iron bars of this portcullis or sliding\\ngate are very thick and heavy, and have sharp points below. A tower stands\\nover the gate, into which the portcullis is drawn up. The defenders of\\ncastles would sometimes conceal themselves and keep perfectly silent on\\nthe approach of an enemy, as if the castle had been abandoned, but as soon\\nas as large a portion of them as they thought they could dispose of, had\\nentered, the portcullis was dropped, which, on account of its immense\\nweight, of course made its way to the ground even, if it had to pierce the\\nbodies of a dozen that stood under it! Hereupon the alarm was sounded and\\nall that were inside were barbarously slaughtered. In some castles there\\nwere large pit-falls full of pointed spears standing upwards. As soon as a\\nlarge part of the enemy were upon this pit, they would be precipitated\\ninto the spears below! At other places there were immense rollers, and\\nonly one approach to the castle, which lead directly up the hill. When the\\nassaulting enemy made its approach by this, the hillside was filled with\\nthe enemy's soldiers, these rollers would be loosened upon them, and thus\\nthe bodies of many thousands would be mangled in a minute! Such was the\\nbarbarity of the ancients.\\n\\nI will not forget the long walk I had all alone through one of the\\nunderground passages of the Heidelberg Castle. I saw a pale light at the\\nother end, when I entered; but it was dark in the middle, and turned out\\nto be much longer than I had anticipated. These passages are about 7 feet\\nhigh and 10 feet wide, and are arched by a brick vault. The illumination\\nof this ruined castle on the evening of August 23rd, constituted one of my\\ngrandest sights in all Europe. It seemed to be enveloped with flames of\\nsuch an intense heat, that its walls, towers, &c., appeared to be about to\\nmelt down! As the colors of the illuminating light changed suddenly from\\nyellowish white to blue, green and red, the scene was so indescribably\\nbeautiful, that numbers of the ten thousand spectators actually went into\\nraptures.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Tun,\\n\\n\\nin the castle of Heidelberg, the largest of all the tuns in the world, is\\n32 feet long, 22 feet in diameter at both ends and 23 feet in the center.\\nIts eighteen wooden hoops are 8 inches thick and 15 inches broad, and its\\n127 staves are 91 inches thick. The bung-hole is 3 to 4 inches in\\ndiameter. To built it cost the enormous sum of $32,000, and its capacity\\nis equal to about 2,200 common barrels! On top of it is a dancing-floor\\nhaving the bung-hole in the center! What a joy it must be for the dancers\\nto reflect that there is such a flood of wine still beneath them! This\\ngiant tun erected as an altar to the jovial God \\\"Bacchus,\\\" has been filled\\ncompletely three times, (1753, 1760, 1766).\\n\\n \\\"In Heidelberg beim grossen Fass\\n Da liess sich's fr\\u00f6hlich sein,\\n Bei einem vollgef\\u00fclten Glas\\n Von edlem Pf\\u00e4lzer Wein;\\n Den als dies Fass kam einst zum stand\\n Do war ein Jubel in dem Land,\\n Da freut' sich Alles, Gross und Klein,\\n Denn voll war es mit Pf\\u00e4lzer Wein.\\\"\\n\\n \\\"In Heidelberg, the 'Grosse Fass,'\\n Caused merry days to shine,\\n When all enjoyed the well filled glass\\n Of noble Pf\\u00e4lzer wine;\\n For when this Tun first came to light,\\n All did in joy combine,\\n To see the 'Fass,' oh wondrous sight!\\n Fill'd up with Pf\\u00e4lzer wine.\\\"\\n\\nThe Philosophenweg, (Philosopher's way), two miles in length, commands\\nsome of the finest prospect on the Rhine. It winds through charming\\nvineyards, and from it may be enjoyed splendid views of the town, castle,\\nvalley, and of the beautiful outlines of the Haardt Mountains and the\\ncathedral of Speyer in the distance.\\n\\nFrom Heidelberg I went to Stuttgart, remarkable for the vast collection\\nof books (300,000 vols.) in the Royal Library. Among these are about 9,000\\nBibles, in some 80 languages!\\n\\nThe Railway Station in Stuttgart is remarkable both for magnificence and\\nthe beauty of its interior. Its wide and lofty passages and splendid\\nwaiting-rooms, are among the grandest in the world.\\n\\nFrom Stuttgart I went to Carlsruhe, famous for the manner in which the\\nstreets meet at the Castle, from every point of the compass. Some thirty\\nstreets meet here like so many sticks of a circular fan. Near the Botanic\\nGarden, is a large Hall of Art rich in paintings and relics.\\n\\n\\n\\nStrassburg.\\n\\n\\nStrassburg, the capital of Alsace and Lorraine, is situated on the River\\nIll, 2 miles from the Rhine, and comprises a population of 80,000\\ninhabitants. Its Cathedral, covering more than an acre of ground and 216\\nfeet in height, is deservedly famous. Its elegant spire, the highest in\\nEurope, is 465 feet in height. To procure a permit from the city\\nauthorities to ascend to the \\\"lantern,\\\" which is immediately below the\\nextreme summit, I walked about the city nearly an hour to find the proper\\nofficial. The view from the platform or roof of the building (216 feet\\nhigh) affords a fine view of the beautiful plains of Alsace, but many\\nascend to the \\\"lantern\\\" simply for the satisfaction of saying that they\\nhave done it. No one is allowed to go higher than the platform, except by\\nspecial permission from the city authorities, and accompanied by a guide\\nand protector, for which an extra ticket is required. The ascent is quite\\neasy for some distance, but by and by the spire becomes too narrow to have\\nstairs on the inside, so that we had to climb up on the outside along\\nladder-like steps. If one would become giddy in this place, he might fall\\nfrom a hight of over four hundred feet into the street below! I cannot\\nstop to speak of the world-renowned astronomical clock which is contained\\nin this cathedral.\\n\\nThe railroad through the Black Forest is one of the great victories of\\ncivil engineering which characterize this age of great undertakings. We\\npassed in exactly one hour through 38 tunnels, during which time, in our\\nascent of the mountains, we passed through one valley three times! When we\\nhad reached the highest point, we saw the two other tracks at different\\nelevations on the mountain side below us! Here we passed for many hours\\nthrough pine forests, all the trees of which were raised from seed, (some\\nsown, and others planted). Many square miles of this mountainous section\\nis covered with pines planted as regularly as our orchards; and the\\nscenery of these mountain-sides green with dense forests in which the\\ncomical tree-tops stand with mathematical exactness in the square or\\nquincunx order, is among the most beautiful imaginable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XV.\\n\\nSwitzerland.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is almost impossible to describe the scenery of the Alps to one who had\\nnever yet ascended mountains above the region of the clouds, without so\\nbewildering his imagination that his fancy will call forth and accept more\\nfictitious notions than true ones. The best description that I had ever\\nheard of the Alps, was the occasion of my most incorrect conceptions about\\nthem. I think the speaker did not misstate or exaggerate anything in a\\nsingle word, but as he could in an hour's talk tell only one tenth of what\\none ought to know, in order to form a correct notion of what the Alps look\\nlike, my fanciful imagination promptly supplied the coloring of the other\\nnine tenths of the picture which he left untouched; and consequently when\\nI came to see the Alps, I found them entirely different from what I had\\nanticipated.\\n\\nThe ordinary school maps represent the Alps as extending along the borders\\nof Switzerland, as if they consisted of a single range, or possibly of\\nseveral parallel ranges, and Mount Blanc as its towering peak. With what\\nsurprise a scholar who only saw these maps, will look about him, when he\\nreaches the summit of any high peak in Switzerland! On the Rigi, for\\nexample, one sees an extent of territory almost 300 miles in circuit,\\nevery part of which is studded with ice-capped peaks. These range not in\\nany one particular direction, nor do they number only several dozen, but\\nmany hundreds of them stand around the beholder toward every point of the\\ncompass and at variable distances, from the Pilatus near by to the most\\ndistant part of the horizon--more than 50 miles away. The snow-clad crowns\\nof many of these rise high above the clouds, so that\\n\\n \\\"Through the parting clouds only\\n The earth can be seen,\\n Far down 'neath the vapour\\n The meadows of green.\\\"\\n\\nThose forms of clouds called cumuli, (P.G. Gewitter Wolken), presenting\\nthemselves the appearance of mountains covered with ice, often creep\\naround these peaks at less than half their height! At Zurich I first\\nbeheld the strange sight of mountains and clouds piled upon each other so\\nthat I could not well distinguish them. It was on a sunny afternoon that I\\nstood on the banks of the _Zuricher See_ (Lake Zurich) and, looking over\\nits calm waters, I beheld in the distant southeast a strange phenomenon.\\nThere stood the high glittering banks of clouds, and over them I saw the\\nblack sides of a towering peak whose top was covered with ice and snow. I\\nthen visited the Rigi and looked at Alpine Switzerland from its giddy\\nheights. This, since the railroad has been completed to its top, is one\\nof the most famous mountains in Switzerland. Though it stands beneath the\\nline of perpectual snow, its top being covered with grass in summer, still\\nit commands a panoramic view of indescribable grandeur. Numerous hotels\\nstand around the top where thousands of tourists find shelter during the\\nsummer nights, and among them is one of the finest hotels in the world.\\nWhen fall comes, all the landlords must take their families and move down\\nfrom the mountain, as it would be impossible to keep the track of the\\nrailroad clear during the winter to bring up the necessary provisions for\\nthem. The snow is often from 10 to 20 feet deep on these Alps.\\n\\nAll Swiss scenery, whether one is on the lakes, upon the mountains, or in\\nthe valleys and ravines, is singularly charming, and bears no resemblance\\nto the scenery which one sees elsewhere; so that for this lack of having\\nsomething with which to compare it, no one can do it justice in any\\ndescription short of a volume. The reader will therefore pardon our haste\\nin this country. One who sees the rest of Europe and not Switzerland, will\\nnot miss any particular links in the historic chain of social, religious\\nand political development of the human race, but he will not have seen the\\nsublime in nature. The Alps are the poetry of inorganic creation, and a\\nweek or two spent on their lakes, in their valleys and gorges, amid the\\nhigh waterfalls or upon their snowfields and glaciers, teaches one to\\nassociate new meanings to the words, grand, sublime, lofty, inspiring,\\noverawing, romantic, wild, precipitous and bewildering, &c. It took me two\\ndays to ascend as high as the Rhone glacier, during which time I walked\\nover 30 miles up hill along old military roads which the Romans\\nconstructed through Switzerland. I saw the snow and ice on the first day\\nalready, and it seemed as if I was but a little below it, but in place of\\nreaching the snow line in the afternoon as I judged I might, I did not\\nreach it until the next afternoon at 5:00 o'clock. The valleys are narrow\\nand the mountains rise in some places almost perpendicularly at the sides,\\nso that the snow and ice which melts near the tops of the mountains, falls\\ndown thousands of feet into the streams below. Water-falls that are from\\nseveral hundred to a thousand feet in height are numerous among the Alps.\\n\\nThe Giessbach Falls which I ascended on the 6th of September, descends in\\na series of seven cascades 1,148 feet, and the Handeck Falls, which I\\npassed on the 5th, precipitates in an unbroken sheet from the height of\\n250 feet! Rainbows stand over all the falls of the Alps, whenever the sun\\nshines.\\n\\nOn the second day (Sept. 4th) of my ascend of the Alps, I could look\\nupwards and see the eternal snows, or look down into the valleys, and see\\nthe people in the meadows and fields making hay or cutting grain!\\nHaymakers may drink the water that was an hour before part of the mass of\\nice and snow which they see hanging near the top of the mountains several\\nthousand feet above their heads! Avalanches slide down into the valleys\\nevery month of the year, and I passed through tunnels and bridges that are\\npurposely constructed that the snow may thus slide over the roads without\\ndoing harm to any one. Where the mountains rise too precipitously, it is\\nin some places impossible to construct a road along the edge; in these\\ncases they pierce through the mountains for considerable distances. The\\nAxenstrasse, along Lake Luzerne, has many such tunnels, one of which is\\nabout one eighth of a mile in length. In the Grimsel, the road avoids a\\nwater-fall by passing through a tunnel under it.\\n\\nThe Rhone Glacier, the only ice-field that I crossed, is upwards of nine\\nmiles in length and rises from 5,751 feet to 10,450 feet in height. About\\nthe time of sunset on the 4th of September, I entered the cavern of ice\\nfrom which issues the stream that constitutes the source of the Rhone\\nRiver. \\\"This is the Rhodanus of the ancients, which was said to issue\\n'from the gates of eternal night at the foot of the pillar of the sun.'\\\"\\n\\nI descended through the Grimsel pass (7,103 feet) and Haslithal along the\\nupper waters of the Aare down to Meiringen, in one day. Though there is\\nonly a bridle-path through the almost unparalled wildnesses of this\\nvalley, still there is a telegraphic wire running up to the hotel at the\\nupper end, near the Rhone Glacier! No language can describe the\\npicturesqueness of the bare rocky sides of this valley. I heard persons\\nwho thought they were alone, utter a dozen exclamations of surprise while\\nmaking a single turn where a new view opened! The solitary tourist will\\nejaculate his exclamations without number; and it is under such\\ncircumstances that the unpoetical soul seeks some personification to whom\\nit may do homage. It would not require a worshipper of images to kneel\\ndown, in the Grimsel or Ober Haslithal, before any emblem that embodied\\nany adequate representation of the crushingly sublime scenery that one\\nbeholds there!\\n\\nI met a lake whose depths seemed as boundless as the blue heavens above\\nme. The water of many of the Swiss lakes is as clear as crystal, so that\\nwhite objects at their bottoms may be discerned at great depths.\\n\\nWhile sailing along the Lake of Geneva one day, I could as little see\\nsubstance in the water below me, when I looked upon it at a certain\\ndistance from the steamer, as in the clear sky; both seemed alike blue and\\nboundless!\\n\\nThe weather and the temperature changes very suddenly among the high Alps.\\nThe climate in the valleys of Switzerland is as warm as ours, in summer,\\nwhile some thousand feet higher lie the everlasting glaciers. From these,\\navalanches of cold air precipitate into the valleys, so that the mercury\\noften falls from 20 to 30 degrees in ten minutes! One is in danger of\\ntaking \\\"a cold\\\" every day in Switzerland.\\n\\nBesides \\\"The Alps\\\" and the _lovely lakes_ among them, the tourist may also\\nsee castles, museums, art galleries, pleasure gardens, &c., in\\nSwitzerland, but I will only enumerate a few of the most striking objects\\nthat I met and saw in this curious country, and then pass on to Italy.\\n\\nOne of the bridges of Lucerne is adorned with very curious paintings\\nrepresenting the \\\"Dance of Death.\\\" Scores of skeletons, some blowing the\\nbugle or playing with the triangles, others equipped with hoes and spades,\\nare jubilant over their work!\\n\\nOne of the finest organs in Europe is the far-famed one at Freiburg,\\nhaving 67 stops and 7,800 pipes, some of them 33 feet long. This\\ninstrument has such a range of volume that it can simulate the roaring\\nthunder as well as the faintest echo. The portal of the same cathedral\\nwhich contains the famous organ is also adorned (?) with a curious\\nrepresentation of the last judgment. St. Peter leads the blessed to the\\ndoor of Heaven, but half a dozen evil ones busy themselves in disposing of\\nthe wicked. One of them that has a head like a hog, carries them from the\\nscales into a large caldron where they are boiled. Others with forks in\\ntheir hands pitch them into the mouth of the large dragon-devil who is\\nrepresented as glutting them, and whose capacious mouth admits of several\\nof them at a time! The time has almost arrived when one may no longer\\ndescribe what he sees in the churches of Europe! This reminds me of a\\nmonster that stands upon a fountain in Bern, called the Kindlifresser,\\n(the Ogre), who is in the act of eating a child, while others doomed to\\nthe same fate protrude from his girdle and pockets!\\n\\nBerne is a great place for bears. Besides those connected with the curious\\nmachinery of the clock on one of its clock-towers, among the dead bears,\\nthey also keep a large den of living bears at the expense of the\\ngovernment. The bear is the heraldic emblem of Switzerland, as is our\\neagle of American freedom.\\n\\nOf the fictitous hero, William Tell, and the nature and character of the\\nSwiss Republic, I can not say more in the compass of this book, than that\\nthe former is a myth and that the latter was in a great measure the\\noutgrowth of poverty.\\n\\nThe reader may form an idea of the miserable dwellings of the peasantry on\\nthe mountains, when he is told that many are hardly distinguishable from\\nthe stables in which the cattle are sheltered.\\n\\nWhen I came into view of Guttannen, the first village of any considerable\\nextent that I passed after seeing the Rhone Glacier and the wildnesses of\\nthe Grimsel and Haslithal, where no houses except hotels, and in some\\nplaces not even trees or grass abound, I felt glad once more to see a\\ngroup of human habitations, and determined to count them, so that I might\\nrecord their number. I passed along the edge of the mountains where I\\ncould easily overlook the village, but it was in many instances impossible\\nto determine by a survey of their external appearances, which were the\\nstables and which the houses or huts, so I counted them all, large and\\nsmall, and found their number between 60 and 90. I once intended to count\\nthese buildings only with windows, as houses; but I soon discovered that\\nsome huts had windows only on one or several sides, and looked like\\nstables on the other sides!\\n\\nA question to dairy men: Do thunder and lightning affect fresh milk? A\\nlady keeping a cafe in Brienz, told me that if a thunder storm overtook\\nthose which were bringing the fresh milk from the mountains, the milk\\nwould suddenly turn sour, so that it could no longer be boiled for\\ndrinking it sweet. She said, \\\"_Es thut sie verbolera, so das sie gerinnt\\nwen man sie kochen will!_\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVI.\\n\\nGeneva to Turin.\\n\\n\\n\\nSwitzerland has two national languages, the German and the French, both of\\nwhich are recognized by the Government. Geneva is French, so I had some\\ntrouble in getting my information and procuring a ticket for Italy. I left\\nGeneva at 6:40 a.m., September 10th; and after passing through a number of\\ntunnels, one of which required 5-1/2 minutes of moderate railway speed, we\\narrived at Bellegarde, on the French border, and passed muster. From 9:00\\nto 10:00 o'clock we were detained at Culoz, and by noon we saw the\\nsnow-covered Alps again. At 3:30 p.m., we arrived at Modane and passed\\nmuster for Italy.\\n\\n\\n\\nMont Cenis Tunnel.\\n\\n\\nWe entered the mouth of this great tunnel, over 8 miles in length, at\\n4:58-1/2 p.m., and were exactly 26 minutes in the very bowels of the\\nearth, where absolute darkness reigns. Temperature in the middle, 59\\u00b0\\nFahrenheit.\\n\\n\\n\\nItaly.\\n\\n\\nWe now come to a country which contrasts as strangely with the nations of\\nwestern Europe, as those do with America, or as Alpine Switzerland does\\nwith the rest of the world. When I parted at Paris with my New York\\nfriend, he bound for Rome, I for the north, we still had our school-boy\\nideas of Germany, Switzerland and Italy; and I shall never forget the\\nremark which he then made, and which embodied my notions and anticipations\\nperhaps as well as his own. He said, \\\"I suppose we have now seen the\\nbrightest side of the picture, the trouble is that scenes will now become\\ntamer as we advance toward the cradle of humanity.\\\" I had been pleasantly\\ndisappointed almost every time that I entered a new country, but now, as I\\nwas entering Italy, I expected that I would surely not see much to\\ninterest me except her rich stores of art and the ancient ruins. But less\\nthan a day at Turin convinced me that I had by no means entered a country\\nwhose people were behind hand in civilization and refinement; and when on\\nmy way from Turin to Milan I saw how much clearer and brighter the blue\\nheavens were, how much sweeter the air smelt than any I had ever breathed\\nbefore, (not excepting that of Paris, even), and how much fairer the\\npeople were than any other that I had yet seen, I felt that I must surely\\nbe on the border of that charming paradise which the poets make of Italy,\\nbut for which I had never given them due credit.\\n\\n\\n\\nItaly's Fair Sons and Daughters.\\n\\n\\nI now come to a dry subject, especially for old people; but numbers of my\\nyoung friends, among them several editors and teachers, requested me very\\nearnestly to take particular notice which country contained the fairest\\nspecimens of the human species. Why these literary characters are so\\ndeeply interested in this question, I cannot tell, but my duty is plain\\nenough--they want \\\"a true and impartial statement of the facts,\\\" which I\\nwill endeavor to render them. I observed everywhere that _culture_ and\\n_personal beauty_ always go together. When I came to a city that had clean\\nand beautiful streets and houses, I invariably found good looking people\\nthere; but in the rural districts generally, and in suburbs and wretched\\ntowns, beauty and culture are at a lower ebb. I now refer to that form of\\nbeauty which is dependent upon personal accomplishments and intellectual\\nendowments and culture--that beauty which beams from an intellectual\\ncountenance and sparkles from eyes that glisten with pleasure. That is the\\nkind of beauty that renders 90 per cent. of the individuals in all\\ncultivated society acceptable, and 20 per cent. charming and attractive,\\nbut which is wanting to nine tenths of those who cannot, or do not, pay\\nattention to cultivation and refinement. There are a very few persons\\nwhose forms and features please and fascinate even without the aid of\\naccomplishments. These may be said to be possessed of _native_ beauty,\\nwhich is met with very seldom in all countries that have a climate\\nunfavorable to health. If I had not gone to Italy, I should not have\\nhesitated to give my preference to the mild climate of Paris, where health\\nand beauty are the natural result of a warm temperature, almost\\nsemi-tropical in mildness, and where the highest art assists to make every\\ngrace shine. But when I saw how nature dotes upon Italy, I felt as if she\\nwas only acting the step-mother to the rest of the world. The loveliest\\nportion of Italy is the valley of the Po. One sees fewer sickly or\\nconsumptive people in some parts of England, France and Germany, than in\\nour section of America, but in Turin and Milan every person looks hale,\\nhealthy, happy and beautiful, from the tender days of infancy to a ripe\\nold age.\\n\\nNothing that I saw in Europe surprised me more than to come so suddenly\\ninto the midst of a people whose very countenance bear the bloom of youth,\\neven until the gray locks of age appear.\\n\\nOld age even knows no wingles here! I know that it seems incredible to any\\none that has never been in warmer climes, but the word beauty has a new\\nmeaning here. The glow which is lambent upon the faces of the sons and\\ndaughters of this section of sunny Italy, is something that I never saw\\nelsewhere, and that cannot be described. It is a solemn truth, that nine\\ntenths of all the ladies of Turin and Milan are perfect beauties; and I\\nneed not say less for the full round forms of the gentlemen. Only after I\\nhad observed that several very fair persons, who happened, to pass near\\nme, had gray hair, did I notice that the bloom of youth still glows upon\\nthe faces of those who are 35 to 40 years of age! When I first came into\\nthis paradise of fairy angels, (for a paradise is the valley of the Po), I\\nmistook this bloom of youth and glow of health and vigor for the lambent\\nflames which flash from the countenances of the intellectual--it seemed to\\nme that I must be surrounded by a halo of literary sages and muses, all\\ngifted alike with every grace and charm that nature can bestow or art\\nimprove; but when I observed the youths at work in the fields and the\\nmaidens at the garden gates, who turned for a moment from their respective\\ntasks to see our train move along, look as happy, as gay and as beautiful\\nas the belles of the cafes and the beaus of the cities, I concluded that\\nit must be the healthy state of the body that makes every face look rosy\\nand bright in this fair and sunny clime. At Milan I asked some of my\\ncompanions how far this _paradise of beauties_ extended southward in\\nItaly. \\\"To Florence,\\\" was the answer. But I did not find that to be quite\\ncorrect, for though Florence may have more fair people than any northern\\ncity, the proportion of beauties to the whole population, which is perhaps\\nninety per cent, in Turin and Milan, cannot be more than 20 or 30 per\\ncent, in Florence. In order to be able to correct any false impression\\nthat I might have imbibed in my first visit to the valley of the Po, I\\npaid particular attention to the same subject on my return from Egypt. At\\nMilan there was then an immense concourse of people assembled from all\\nparts of Europe to see Emperor William of Germany and King Victor Emanuel\\nof Italy parade the streets of that elegant city, with a retinue of over\\n20,000 soldiers; the consequence was, that the fair people of Milan were\\nlost in the multitude. But on my return to Turin, I found that her\\nbeautiful sons and daughters, again presented the same dream-like and\\nenchanting scene of a pleasure-garden full of fair and merry beings\\npossessed of angelic beauty, and enjoying their blessed existance just as\\nI had seen them a month before.\\n\\nI met travelers that say the same thing of Nature's children in other\\nsunny lands--Spain for example. The truth seems to be, that in warm\\nclimates only, will man attain that perfect healthy and beautiful physical\\ndevelopment which has constituted the model of the artist and the theme of\\nthe poet, in every age. I have heard some pronounce the statue of Venus de\\nMedici, the ideal perfection of female form and beauty. It is probably as\\nnear as sculpture can reach it, but who would suppose that a white stone\\ncould do justice to the beauty of a pure child of nature? The marble may\\npresent a most perfect _form_; but what becomes of the glow of life and\\nflush of beauty upon the maiden's cheek, the ruby lips and the grace and\\nelegance of her movements and winning manners? We may speak of ideal\\nbeauty in countries where the physical development of the inhabitants is\\nblasted by the severities of the extreme heat and cold of an inhospitable\\nclime, where the blasts of winter make every form shiver for many months\\nof the year; but the superior beauty of the daughters of Northern Italy,\\nif they were placed side by side with Venus de Medici, would laugh that\\nfrigid form to scorn! As compared with these, I thought I had seen no\\nothers that could either _talk_ or _laugh_ or _walk_!\\n\\nThe Italians live upon a very simple diet. When I first saw numbers of\\nthem make meals of dry bread and fruit, I supposed poverty impelled them\\nto partake of so scant a diet, but by the time I came back from Egypt, I\\ntoo had learned to sit down and eat dry bread and grapes together, though\\nI could procure meat as cheap in Italy as elsewhere in Europe. It is not\\nadvisable to partake of much meat in any warm country. Any one may form an\\nidea of what kind of a consumer of food cold is, when he reflects how much\\nmore flesh we consume in winter than in summer. I did not partake of more\\nthan half the amount of food in southern Italy and Egypt that I needed in\\nEngland, Germany or Switzerland, and there is little room for doubt that\\nmany Italians do with one third of the amount of food that we require in\\nthe severer climate of the Middle States. I was always reminded of the\\nstory of \\\"Cornaro the Italian,\\\" related in Wilson's Fourth Reader,\\nwhenever I saw them eat their simple meals. It is very singular, too, that\\nthey should all look full, healthy and robust; and many of us, on the\\ncontrary, lean and sickly. Twelve ounces of solid food and thirteen ounces\\nof drink, seems a very spare supply to an American, but I do not believe\\nthat it is accounted very extraordinary in Italy.\\n\\n\\n\\nMilan.\\n\\n\\nThe praises of the magnificence and splendor of the Cathedral of Milan are\\nsung all over the world. It is nearly 500 feet long and 250 feet wide\\nthrough the transepts, covering an area of almost _two acres and three\\nquarters!_ The height of the nave is 150 feet! Its entire walls, and its\\npinnacles, spire and roof are all constructed of fine marble. The spire is\\nover 350 feet high. The marble slabs constituting the roof are about three\\ninches thick; how enormous the weight of that roof must be! Each of the\\n135 pinnacles or smaller spires is crowned with a statue, and throngs of\\nothers (some 4,500) ornament the outside of this magnificent building. The\\ninterior of this edifice is one of the most imposing in the world. As I\\nlooked at the rich decorations and delicate traceries of its high ceiling,\\n150 feet above me, I felt as if no human being could be worthy of enjoying\\nsuch a magnificent view. But, \\\"unless a language be invented full of\\nlance-headed characters, and Gothic vagaries of arch and finial, flower\\nand fruit, bird and beast,\\\" the beauties and glories of the temples of\\nItaly, and her unparalleled galleries of art, can never be described. From\\nMilan I went to Vicenza, where I spent a sleepless night in skirmishes\\nwith the mosquitoes! The number and variety of obnoxious insects\\nmultiplies fearfully as one approaches the topical regions. Thence I went\\nto\\n\\n\\n\\nVenice.\\n\\n\\nAs I was very much disappointed with Venice, I shall not occupy much time\\nin describing this _daughter of the sea_. The railway bridge which leads\\nto this city is about two miles long. I expected that a city whose streets\\nare canals and whose carriages are all boats, would present a very unique\\nappearance, but when I once saw them, they were so exactly what I had\\nanticipated, that I felt disgusted and left the city without doing justice\\neven to the vast collection of paintings in the Ducal Palace, which alone\\nis worth going a great distance to see.\\n\\n\\n\\nSan Marco.\\n\\n\\nThe church of _San Marco_ is one of the grandest and most wonderful\\nstructures in Italy, and I can only refrain from copying Ruskin's very\\nfine description of it, because his account, though true in every\\nparticular, would, to one who has never seen any of the architectural\\nglories of Italy, seem more like the attempt of a poet to depict in\\nglowing language the vagaries of a dream, than like the description of an\\nedifice really in existance.\\n\\nOn the Piazza above the portal of San Marco, stand the celebrated bronze\\nhorses \\\"which Constantine carried from Rome to Constantinople, whence\\nMarino Zeno brought them hither in 1205; they were taken to Paris by\\nNapoleon in 1797, but restored by the Allies in 1815.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVII.\\n\\nVenice to Bologna.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn place of spending several days at Venice, as I now think I should have,\\nI left already in the afternoon at 3:35 o'clock, and reached Bologna that\\nevening. It required between 6 and 7 minutes to cross the bridge, over two\\nmiles long, which connects Venice with the land. The water is not deep,\\nand most of this bridge is a mere bank of earth running into the sea. It\\nwas on account of my being disgusted at the general unpretending\\nappearance of Venice, that I left her so soon. Among the objects of\\ninterest that I saw between Venice and Bologna, was a herd of a hundred\\ndeer on a hill-side, and the merry bells of stage-teams jingling like our\\nsleigh-bells, but which may be heard in Italy and Switzerland all the year\\nround. When I observed in my Satchel Guide that Bologna has two _leaning\\ntowers_, one of them nearly 300 feet high leaning 4 feet, and the other\\nabout half that height and leaning 8 feet, I determined to go and see\\nthem. They are massive but plain brick structures, and it is difficult to\\ndecide which way the higher one leans. The inclination of the lower one,\\nhowever, is decided, but presents nothing striking or threatening in its\\nappearance. I felt afraid that the Leaning Tower of Pisa might possibly\\nalso fail to present anything that was remarkable or imposing to the\\nbeholder when I would come to see it once, just as a thousand and one\\nother objects do which antiquity and poetry have rendered sacred and\\nfamous; and I walked away with down-cast countenance and took passage for\\nFirenze (Florence).\\n\\n\\n\\nFlorence.\\n\\n\\nThe Cathedral, (Il Duomo), begun in 1298, is 554 feet long; and 334 feet\\nthrough the transepts. The nave is 152 feet high; the cupola is 138 feet\\nin diameter or about the same as that of St. Peter's in Rome, for which it\\nalso served Michael Angelo as a model.\\n\\nClose by the cathedral is Giotto's Campanile, 300 feet high, the most\\nbeautiful of all the towers that I have seen in Europe. The square blocks\\nof many colored marble with which its four sides are coated, produce a\\nrichness of effect that is indescribable. Decorated from top to bottom\\nwith all manner of statues and architectural ornamentations, \\\"it is like a\\ntoy of ivory, which some ingenious and pious monk might have spent his\\nlife-time in adorning with sculptural designs and figures of saints; and\\nwhen it was finished, seeing it so beautiful, he prayed that it might be\\nmiraculously magnified from the size of one foot to that of three\\nhundred.\\\" The view of this superb structure in connection with the grand\\nedifice (the Cathedral) to which it belongs, opens so suddenly upon the\\nvisitor, that he will never forget what feelings of joy and surprise he\\nexperienced on making the last turn around the corner, when these splendid\\nedifices leaped upon him so unexpectedly in all their beauty and magesty.\\n\\nThe church of Santa Croce, whose foundation was laid in 1294, is \\\"the\\nPantheon of Tuscany.\\\" It contains the tomb of Michael Angelo, and\\nmagnificent monuments of Dante, of Alfiero, of Macchiavelli, of Galileo\\nand of many others of less fame.\\n\\nThe houses in which were born Michael Angelo, Dante, Amerigo Vespucci,\\nMacchiavelli and Galileo may be found and identified by the memorial\\ntablets which mark them.\\n\\n_Piazza della Signoria_ is the business as well as the historic center of\\nFlorence. Here stands the old capitol of the republic, begun in 1298. It\\nwas afterwards the residence of Cosmo I. Near this palace is a magnificent\\nfountain of the time of Cosmo I. I cannot tell positively, now, whether\\nthe sculpture and architecture of Florence is so much richer than what I\\nsaw elsewhere in Europe, or whether the enchanting beauty of sculpturesque\\nand architectural master-strokes at the Cathedral, the Campanile, St.\\nCroce, and the Fountain and Palace in this magnificent square, may not\\nhave thrown me into the condition of one in a dream; but I certainly felt\\nall the time that I spent in Florence like one in another world, where\\nscenes of fascinating beauty were surrounding me on every side, and\\nfeelings of ecstatic delight precluding me from any but a dream-like\\nenjoyment of the scenery around. I was without any acquaintance or\\ncompanion the whole day, which in connection with the fact that I was\\nthousands of miles away from the familiar scenes of home, where every\\nobject that I contemplated was new and different from what I was wont to\\nsee, could not fail to make me feel like one in a dream. I went along the\\n_Portico degli Uffizi_ adorned with throngs of statues of celebrated\\nTuscans, and into the famous Uffizi Gallery, founded by the Medici, and\\none of the most precious collections in the world. In the _Tribune_, the\\ninner sanctuary of the great temple of art (\\\"the richest room in all the\\nworld, a heart that draws all hearts to it\\\") I saw the Venus de Medici,\\nthe Dancing Faun, the Apollino, the Wrestlers, and other masterpieces of\\nancient sculpture; also, among the paintings, some of the best works of\\nRaphael, Angelo, Titian and others. I must however admit that the out-door\\nscenery of Florence charmed me more than what I saw in its world renowned\\nmuseum. It seems to me, that Raphael and M. Angelo deserve more praise for\\nthe inventive genius which they evinced in translating bible stories and\\npoetical imagery into pictures, than for their mechanical execution. To\\nsuch as understand anything about paintings, it will seem very absurd, of\\ncourse, that I should presume to criticise the paintings of these great\\nmasters, but they must admit that a hundred of those who roam the world\\nand come to see the works of the masters, are ignorant of painting and\\nsculpture, as I am, to half a dozen that are able to criticise them from\\nthe standpoint of one who is himself an artist. The \\\"hundred\\\" unskilled in\\nthe fine arts, have as great a desire to know how they will likely be\\naffected by the sight of those works as the half dozen artists are; permit\\nme to speak to the \\\"hundred!\\\" It is true that the paintings of Raphael and\\nAngelo may have faded, but, whatever they may have been when they were\\nfirst hung to the wall, they now look pale, shady and inferior in artistic\\nexecution to many of those of Rubens and of the masters of the Dutch\\nschool in general; that is, if we consider nature as the standard and\\ncopying it as the only criterion of a master's talents. But for inventive\\noriginality of conception, the Dutch masters are no rivals even, certainly\\nnot, of the Italians.\\n\\nNeed I repeat that wherever one finds such a rich store of art as in\\nFlorence, there too will he find ladies and gentlemen of beauty, culture\\nand refinement? The same fascinating forms and features which characterize\\nthe men and women of Turin and Milan, are also met with here, but they\\ncomprise a much smaller proportion of the whole population. It is fair to\\npresume, however, that a large proportion of those which I saw in Florence\\nwere natives of distant parts of the globe, which streamed thither, by the\\nthousand, to see that charming city. One can nowhere see more intelligent\\ncompany than in such a place as Florence; but how the most symmetrical and\\nbest looking people of all other countries contrast with Italian beauties,\\nnone but those few who ever go thither will ever learn to form the least\\nconception of. It has become my duty, however, to record the fact, that\\nthe most favored of all countries when they sail into the society of the\\nfair daughters of sunny Italy cast a shadow about them, as we may fancy\\nany human would when coming into the company of the beautiful angels of a\\nheavenly Paradise. Go reader, if you cannot visit Italy personally, and\\nsee what the poets say about these people, and believe every word they can\\nsay in favor of their charms.\\n\\n\\n\\nPisa.\\n\\n\\nFrom Florence I went to Pisa with the special object of seeing the famous\\nLeaning Tower (1174-1350). It is circular, having 15 pillars in the wall\\nof the first story and 30 in each of the six succeeding ones. On top of\\nthese, is another one (the eighth) much smaller than the rest, and\\nprobably built upon it after the tower had reached the amount of\\ninclination which it now has. The entire structure is 187 feet high, and\\n173 feet 9 inches in circumference (according to my own measurement). The\\nwalls are from 5 to 7 feet thick. There is a peal of bells at the top, the\\nheaviest weighing 6 tons. Nothing is more evident than that this tower\\nassumed its leaning position by _accident_. It is probable that this\\nstructure, which is the finest in Italy except Giotto's Campanile at\\nFlorence, was originally designed to be a very high one, (perhaps 300\\nfeet). It is likely that the foundation did not give way until at the\\nseventh story, and that after it came to a stand-still again, they capped\\nit off abruptly by the odd little story which we now see at the top of it.\\nThe inclination amounts to about 13 feet. There is a circular pavement\\naround it about 10 feet wide, which has the same angle of inclination that\\nthe tower itself has. It is sunk 3 feet into the ground on one side and 8\\nfeet on the other side. Upon careful examination and measurement I\\ndiscovered that the diameter of the basin thus formed is to the height of\\nthe tower, as the inclination of pavement constituting the floor of the\\nbasin is to the amount of inclination of the tower.\\n\\nLet it be remembered, that this tower is not an independent structure, but\\nthat it stands near the east end of the Cathedral, as the elegant\\ncampanile at Florence stands near the cathedral of that city.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Cathedral.\\n\\n\\nThe Cathedral (1063-1118) is 311 feet long, 106 feet wide, and the nave\\n109 feet high. The great bronze lamp which gave Galileo the hint of the\\npendulum, still hangs in its nave.\\n\\nThe Baptistry (1153-1278) stands a little distance from the west end of\\nthe Cathedral. It is about 120 feet in diameter and its dome is 180 feet\\nhigh. Peabody considers it \\\"the most faultlessly and exquisitely\\nbeautiful building\\\" he ever saw.\\n\\nThese three most elegant buildings, the Cathedral, the Baptistry and the\\nCampanile or Leaning Tower, are a unite in architectural beauty and\\ndesign, and for effect in external appearance are scarcely outvied by\\nanything that I have seen of the kind in all Italy. No one will feel sorry\\nfor having traveled a hundred miles to see the \\\"Leaning Tower,\\\" and the\\ntraveler will observe with pleasure and satisfaction that its two\\ncompanions are even more elegant than itself.\\n\\nOn Tuesday noon, September 15th, I left Pisa for Rome. It was continually\\n\\n\\n\\nGetting Warmer,\\n\\n\\nas I progressed southward. At London I had received information that I\\nmust by no means go to Rome before October, as I might not be able to\\nendure the intense heat of summer in central Italy.\\n\\nThe tourist must not always believe all that is said. Though it is not so\\npleasant to visit Rome in July or August, as later in the season, still it\\nis quite as safe, if one takes the necessary precautions against fever. No\\none should eat much meat in Italy and Egypt. I lived upon milk, bread and\\nfruit principally, and dressed in flannel; and as a consequence, never\\nexperienced much inconvenience from any source--not from heat even. At\\nRome I used an umbrella during the middle of the day, and in Egypt all of\\nthe day, but with that to protect me from the effect of the direct rays of\\nthe sun, I could get along tolerably well.\\n\\nAt Milan a young friend had cautioned me to be careful at Rome, as persons\\nwere often murdered there in broad daylight! I was not at all alarmed by\\nthat remark, because I had previously received similarly reports in regard\\nto the morality of other cities, and had discovered that they were\\nunfounded. As our train was sweeping on toward Rome, I apprehended little\\ndanger, therefore, from these sources, and after having formed the\\nacquaintance of a certain Frenchman, the professor of mathematics of the\\nUniversity of Brest, who could speak a very little English, I began to\\nhave brighter hopes in regard to my visit to Rome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVIII.\\n\\nRome.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sun set soon after we had passed Orbetello, and the moon rose about\\nthe same time. We had still two hours to Civita Vecchia and four hours to\\nRome, but I shall never forget the happiness and emotional excitement that\\nprevailed among our passengers, as we were approaching the city of the\\nCaesars and of the Popes, on that pleasant moonlight evening. The light of\\nthe full moon cast a charm about every scene, and as we watched the\\nappearance of tropical species of plants and trees under the subdued and\\nenchanted light of the moon and stars, we felt that we were about to enter\\nthe celestial city under eminently fascinating circumstances. At 10:00\\no'clock we were intently looking from the windows, each for the first\\nglimpse of Rome. Will we reach the Tiber soon? As our train leaped upon\\nthe bridge and my French companion first saw the glassy surface of the\\nhistoric stream, he, half distracted by solemnity of the occasion,\\nexclaimed with a forced but feeble effort, \\\"THE TIBER, _the Tiber_!\\\" None\\nwas his own, and the enraptured Professor, sinking from the effects of an\\necstatic swoon, grasped hold of me and with labored enunciation spoke in a\\nlow voice, saying, \\\"I feel in-ex-pres-si-ble e-mo-sions!\\\"\\n\\nAt 10:20 we entered the shed of the great Railway Station. It was my good\\nfortune to meet a German porter who conducted me and my new companion to\\nan excellent hotel (Albergo Torino E Trattoria duetto da Abrate--Via\\nPrincipe Amedo in prossimita alla Stazione) where we took rooms together.\\n\\nOne sees a thousand strange and curious things at Rome that my limited\\nspace will preclude me from describing or mentioning, even. The gable-end\\nof the Stazione (Station) has in base relief a representation of the\\ntraditional she-wolf nursing the twin brothers, Romulus and Remus, the\\nfounders of Rome.\\n\\nEmblems unique and obscure in design, may be seen in almost every street.\\nI saw in one place the hands of a clock dial in the form of snakes.\\n\\nI did more justice to my eyes than to my feet, during my first day in\\nRome. The Column of Marcus Aurelius, the Post-Office, Castello S. Angelo,\\nSt. Peter, the Vatican, the Colosseum _(Amfiteatro Flavia,_ or _Coliseo_)\\nand the fountains, arches and ruins of ancient heathen temples that I\\npassed on my way, gave me a pretty good practical idea of the Rome that I\\nhad read about in the books. Only the approaching darkness and the dread\\nof walking alone through the suburbs of Rome under cover of night, could\\ninduce me on the evening of the first day to tear myself away from the\\ncrumbling heaps of stones which constitute the ruins of ancient Rome, so\\ncharming and grand to behold.\\n\\nIt required about three days of close study before I could readily\\nidentify on my map of ancient Rome, the temples of Vespasian, of Saturn,\\nof Castor and Pollux, of Julius Caesar, of Faustina, and of Venus and\\nRoma; the triumphal arches of Titus, of Severus and of Constantine; the\\n_Meta Sudarite_, and the Column of Phocas, in the _Roman Forum_; also the\\nColumn of Trajan and other objects in the Forum of Trajan, and numerous\\nother ruins of ancient Rome, including the aqueducts, baths, and the\\nlittle round Temple of Vesta (?) on the left bank of the Tiber.\\n\\nThe Rome of to-day is about a mile and a half square, and has a population\\nof 245,000 inhabitants. Ancient Rome occupied much more territory, and its\\npopulation was _at the beginning of the 2nd century_ about 1-1/2 million.\\nThe ruins of ancient Rome cover a desolate area of several square miles in\\nextent, besides what is covered by the modern city. Its walls are 15 miles\\nin circuit.\\n\\nWhatever may be said of the 364 churches of Rome, (including seven called\\nBasilicae, namely: St. Peter, St. John Lateran, Santa Maria Maggiore, and\\nSanta Croce in Gerusalemme, within the city, and St. Paolo, San Lorenzo\\nand San Sebastian, outside of the walls), all agree, that\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Colosseum\\n\\n\\nis the _elephant_ among the ruins of the old city. This stupendous\\nstructure is eliptical in form, measuring 615 feet through the longer\\ndiameter and 510 feet through the shorter, covering more than 5-1/2 acres\\nof ground. In the height of its glory 87,000 spectators could he\\naccommodated within its walls! It is 156 feet high, but has no roof. The\\nsailors of the imperial fleet used to stretch sail-cloth over it to\\nexclude the burning rays of the sun. The arena is 279 feet by 174 feet.\\nThis building was begun in A.D. 72, and dedicated by Titus in A.D. 80. It\\nwas inaugurated by gladiatorial combats which lasted 100 days, during\\nwhich time 5,000 wild animals were killed. About one third of the building\\nis still preserved, and presents a scene to the beholder of overawing\\nmagnificence and grandeur. When I walked into the Cathedral of Milan, I\\nfelt as if its elevated ceiling was about to lift me up, but, standing in\\nthe arena of this vast amphitheater, one feels as if its stupendous walls\\nwould crush him to the ground. Close by the Colosseum is the Meta Sudans,\\nand the Arch of Constantine which spans the _Via Triumphalis_ and unites\\nit with _Via Sacra_ (the Sacred Way). This arch has three passages and is\\nadorned with admirable sculptures. It was erected in 311, when Constantine\\ndeclared himself in favor of Christianity. Following the Sacred way,\\ntoward the north, we first come to the arch of Titus and afterwards to\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Roman Forum.\\n\\n\\nThe Sacred Way, it seems, was about 3/8 of a mile in length and extended\\nfrom the Arch of Constantine or the northern end of the Colosseum near\\nby, to the Capitol. Near the Capitol stands the Triumphal Arch of\\nSeptimius Severus, 75 feet high and 82 feet wide, with three passages. It\\nwas erected in honor of that emperor and his two sons Caracalla and Geta\\nin A.D. 203, to commemorate victories. It was once surmounted by a brazen\\nchariot with six horses, on which stood Severus, crowned by Victory. The\\npavement of the Forum, which has been laid bare by recent diggings, lies\\nsome twenty feet lower than the level of the street which now passes at\\nthe side of the diggings. Near the northern end stands the Column of\\nPhocas, 54 feet high, which was erected in 608 in honor of the tyrant\\nPhocas, of the Eastern Empire. All around the Forum stand what remains of\\nthe ancient temples, once dedicated to the deities which it was believed\\npresided over the destinies of Rome, before the advent of Christianity.\\nThe broken pillars of ruined temples are seen on every side.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Tabularium.\\n\\n\\nThe only relics still extant of the ancient Capitol of Rome are the ruins\\nof the Tabularium, erected B.C. 78, by the consul Q. Lutatius Catulus for\\nthe reception of the state archives. The modern Capitol covers a part of\\nit. The Tarpeian Rock, from which the condemned used to be thrown by the\\nancient Romans, is close by this edifice, _if_ the _Rupe Tarpeia_ still\\npointed out is the veritable one.\\n\\nAdjoining the Tabularium is the _Schola Xantha_, \\\"With the _Colonnade of\\nthe Twelve Gods_, whose images Vettius Agorius Pr\\u00e6textatus, the pr\\u00e6fectus\\nurbi, and one of the principal champions of expiring paganism, erected\\nhere in A.D. 367.\\\" The _Twelve Gods_ stand in base relief, on a beautiful\\nvase in the corridor of the Capitoline Museum, in the following order:\\nJupiter, Juno, Minerva, Hercules, Apollo, Diana, Mars, Venus, Vesta,\\nMercury, Neptune and Vulcan. It is a remarkable coincidence(?), that there\\nare: First, _Twelve_ Lunations in a year; Second, _Twelve_ Months in a\\nyear; Third, _Twelve_ Constellations in the heavens; Fourth, _Twelve_ Gods\\nin the ancient mythology; Fifth, _Twelve_ Labors of Hercules; Sixth, see\\nLaw of the _Twelve_ tables(?), Encyclop\\u00e6dia Britannica on Burying;\\nSeventh, _Twelve_ Sons of Jacob; Eighth, _Twelve_ Tribes of Israel; Ninth,\\n_Twelve_ Apostles of Christ; Tenth, _Twelve_ Virtues and _Twelve_ Vices\\nrepresented in base reliefs in Notre Dame, Paris; Eleventh, _Twelve_\\nColossal statues facing the tomb of Napoleon I.; and Twelfth, _Twelve_\\nunits in a dozen.\\n\\nIt is strange enough that there are _a dozen dozen_ of these curious\\n_dozens_!\\n\\nDid Pythagoras not also have twelve spheres to make his sphere-music?\\n\\nBetween the Tabularium and the Forum, about 150 feet southeast from the\\nformer, and near the Arch of Severus, are the \\\"remains of\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Rostra,\\n\\n\\nor orator's tribune, a name derived from the iron prows of the war-ships\\nof Antium with which the tribune was adorned after the capture of that\\ntown in B.C. 338. At the end of it was the _Umbilicus urbis Rom\\u00e6_, or\\nideal center of the city and empire, the remains of which are\\nrecognizable. At the other end, below the street, are a few traces of the\\n_Miliareum Aureum_, or central mile-stone of the roads radiating from\\nRome, erected by Augustus in B.C. 28. It is however doubtful whether these\\nnames are correctly applied to these remains.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Temple of C\\u00e6sar\\n\\n\\nis situated on the east side of the Forum, with its front toward the\\nCapitol. To this, \\\"Caesar, in addition to other alterations made by him,\\ntransferred the tribune of the orators. This was now named the _Rostra\\nJulia_, and from it, on the occasion of the funeral of the murdered\\ndictator on the 19th or 20th March, B.C. 44, Mark Antony pronounced the\\ncelebrated oration which wrought so wonder-fully on the passions of the\\nexcited populace. A funeral pyre was hastily improvised, and the\\nunparalleled honor accorded to the illustrious dead of being burned in\\nview of the most sacred shrines of the city. A column with the inscription\\n'parenti patriae' was afterwards erected here to commemorate the event. At\\na later period Augustus erected this temple in honor of 'Divus Julius,'\\nhis defied uncle and adopted father, and dedicated it to him in B.C. 29,\\nafter the battle of Actium. At the same time he adorned the rostra with\\nprows of the captured Egyptian vessels.\\\"--_B\\u00e6deker_.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Baths of Caracalla.\\n\\n\\nAs an example of the magnificence of the ancient Roman baths, we may take\\nthe Thermae of Caracalla which could accommodate 1,600 bathers at a time!\\nThis establishment, now the largest mass of ruins in Rome, except the\\nColosseum, was 720 feet long and 372 feet wide. A flight of 98 steps lead\\nto the roof which (the roof) has now tumbled down. This structure covered\\nover six acres of ground, and had its porticoes, race course, &c.,\\nsurrounded by a wall. The total area of the grounds is nearly 27 acres!\\n\\nThe Baths of Diocletian, erected in the 4th century, were 6,000 feet in\\nperimeter and its number of daily bathers were 3,000.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Pyramid of Cestius.\\n\\n\\n\\\"The Egyptian pyramidal form was not unfrequently employed by the Romans\\nin the construction of their tombs.\\\" That of Cestius, who died within the\\nlast thirty years before Christ, is 116 feet high and 98 feet square at\\nthe base. It is constructed with bricks and covered with marble blocks.\\n\\nUpon the Cemetery of St. Lorenzo, \\\"the great modern burial-ground of\\nRome,\\\" I saw one or several small monuments or head stones which were in\\nthe form of pyramids. Here, as in Catholic burial-grounds generally in\\nEurope, crosses take the place of memorial stones, except some of the\\nlatest interments are marked by marble slabs and monuments.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Catacombs\\n\\n\\nor underground burial-places of Rome, are not quite as interesting as many\\nsuppose who have read large chapters and heard long addresses upon the\\nsubject. The passages are almost innumerable, intersecting each other in\\nevery direction and ranging in some places many stories above each other,\\nbut still, as you pass along in the dim light of a little taper, it\\nappears much like a subterranean stone-quarry containing pigeon-holes for\\nthe dead.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Temple of Vesta.\\n\\n\\nThe little round temple referred to on page 244, was once supposed to have\\nbeen the temple of Vesta, but it is now quite certain that this was a\\nmistake. It is 50 feet in diameter and each of its 20 Corinthian columns\\nwhich constitute the circular colonnade around it, is 32 feet high.\\nWherever the Temple of Vesta may have stood, it is evident that from its\\neternal fires was borrowed the custom, still extant in Catholic churches,\\nof keeping up a perpetual flame by means of tapers. Six Vestal Virgins\\nsworn to perpetual virginity, used to watch the sacred flame upon the\\naltar in the Temple of Vesta, and it is an impressive sight to see the\\nsame sacred and eternal flame still burning around the High Altar in St.\\nPeter's. From what may still be seen in Europe in general, and at Rome in\\nparticular, it is evident that all or nearly all of the emblems, forms\\nand ceremonies of the _early_ Catholic Church were borrowed from ancient\\nmythology.\\n\\n\\n\\nObelisks and Fountains.\\n\\n\\nThe many magnificent fountains of Rome are all adorned with groups\\nrepresenting characters of ancient mythology, as is the case with nearly\\nall the fountains of Europe and America, even unto this day, and the half\\na dozen or more obelisks of Rome are likewise monuments of the heathen\\norigin of modern civilization. These, it seems, were first erected and\\ndedicated to the sun, as we may infer from the fact that globes\\nrepresenting the sun surmount them. Since the introduction of the\\nChristian religion, a figure of St. Peter with the cross is placed upon\\nsome of them. Hence, the development of religious ideas stands\\nchronologically thus: First, Sun-worship and afterwards the elevation of\\nSt. Peter, and of the Cross. Judging from what we see on ancient monuments\\nand in the churches, it is perhaps a fair question, whether St. Peter, the\\nVirgin and other saints were not at one time quite as much the' object of\\nworship, as Christ himself?\\n\\n\\n\\nSt. Peter's.\\n\\n\\n\\\"St. Peter's stands on the site of the circus of Nero, where many\\nChristians were martyred and where St. Peter is said to have been buried\\nafter his crucifixion.\\\" An oratory (chapel?) stood here as early as A.D.\\n90. In 309 a basilica, half the size of what St. Peter's now is, was begun\\nby Constantine. It was the grandest church of that time. \\\"The crypt is\\nnow the only remnant of this early basilica.\\\" The building of the present\\nedifice was commenced in 1506 by Julius II. Michael Angelo worked 17 years\\nat it (to 1564). It was completed and \\\"consecrated by Pope Urban VIII., on\\n18th November, 1626, on the 1300th anniversary of the day on which St.\\nSilvester is said to have consecrated the original edifice.\\\"\\n\\nThis church contains 29 altars, besides the high altar. \\\"Its area is\\n212,321 sq. ft., while that of the cathedral of Milan is 117,678, St.\\nPaul's at London 108,982, St. Sophia at Constantinople 96,497, and the\\nCathedral of Cologne 73,903 sq. ft.\\\" The nave is 87 feet wide and 150 feet\\nhigh, and the dome is 138 feet in diameter (5 feet less than that of the\\nPantheon) and some 450 feet high. One might fill a volume in describing\\nits rich marble pavement, its 148 massive columns, its gilded chapels and\\nceiling, its fine sculpture, and the thousand and one objects in and about\\nit that render it the most imposing as well as the largest church in the\\nworld. Imagine yourself in the middle of a church occupying over five\\nacres, whose High Altar stands under a brass canopy 95 feet high, and\\nweighing 93 tons, and whose _Confessio_ is surrounded by 89 burning lamps!\\nThe total cost of the edifice is about $85,000,000. [It should always be\\nremembered that labor has been twice to three times as cheap in Europe as\\nit is now in this country]. \\\"The expense of erecting this church was so\\nheavy that Julius II. and Leo X. resorted to the sale of indulgences to\\nraise the money, and this lead to the Reformation.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Lateran\\n\\n\\nis the church of the Pope as bishop of Rome, and here his coronation takes\\nplace. \\\"It takes the precedence even of St. Peter, in ecclesiastical rank,\\nbeing, as the inscription on its facade sets forth, '_c Ominum Urbis Et\\nUrbis Ecclesiarum Mater Et Caput._'\\\"\\n\\nIf St. Peter's had not the advantage of a piazza that is unrivaled in\\nmagnificence, I think the lofty facade of the Lateran would present a view\\nof more imposing grandeur, even, than that stately structure. The interior\\nof this church is very beautiful. It must not be supposed that St. Peter's\\nhas no rivals in beauty. Even in Rome it does not seem to stand alone. Of\\nthe 363 other churches in the great city of churches, there are numbers\\nthat vie with it in the beauty and perfection of some particular portions.\\n\\n\\n\\nSanta Maria Maggiore.\\n\\n\\n\\\"The Virgin appeared simultaneously to the devout Roman patrician Johannes\\nand to Pope Liberius in their dreams, commanding them to erect a church to\\nher on the spot where they should find a deposit of snow on the following\\nmorning (August 5th).\\\" The Basilica Liberiana which was erected in\\nobedience of this vision, was succeeded by a church named S. Maria Mater\\nDei (A.D. 432) and later by the present edifice. Almost every church in\\nRome has its legend. I have seen no other church that seemed so rich in\\ngold, precious alabaster and many other kinds of beautiful and costly\\nstones. Its panelled roof is gilt with the first gold brought to Spain\\nfrom South America, and presented to the Pope by Ferdinand and Isabella.\\n\\nNear S. Maria Maggiore is the church of\\n\\n\\n\\nS. Antonio Abbate,\\n\\n\\nto which are brought the horses, mules, cows, etc., during the week\\nfollowing the feast of the saint (January 17-23). On the 23rd, the Pope\\nand many persons of the higher classes send their horses here to be\\nblessed and sprinkled with holy water.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Scala Santa\\n\\n\\nreferred to on page 189 of this book, are in a church near the Lateran.\\nThey were brought to Rome by the Empress Helena and may only be ascended\\non the knees. They are partly covered with boards, to save the stones from\\nbeing worn away by the thousands that ascend it. Two adjoining stairways\\nare for the descent.\\n\\n\\n\\nS. Pietro in Vincoli\\n\\n\\nwas founded about 442, as the receptacle for the chains of St. Peter,\\nwhich had been presented by Eudoxia, wife of Valentinian III., to Pope Leo\\nI. This church contains the famous statue of Moses with horns, by Michael\\nAngelo. Mediaeval Christian artists generally represented Moses with\\nhorns, owing to an erroneous translation of Exodus XXXIV., 35. Michael\\nAngelo represented these horns upon the head of Moses as having been about\\nthree inches in length.\\n\\n\\n\\nS. Maria in Aracoeli\\n\\n\\nprobably occupies the site of the Temple of Jupiter. Its present altar\\nencloses an ancient altar which is said to have been erected by Augustus.\\n\\\"According to a legend of the 12th century, this was the spot where the\\nSibyl Tibur appeared to the emperor, whom the senate proposed to elevate\\nto the rank of a god, and revealed to him a vision of the Virgin and her\\nSon.\\\"\\n\\nThis church is approached by a very high flight of steps rising from the\\nfoot of those leading to the piazza of the modern Capitol, and \\\"the\\ninterior is vast, solemn, and highly picturesque. It was here, as Gibbon\\ntells us, that on the 15th of October, 1764, as he sat musing amidst the\\nruins of the Capitol, while the barefooted friars were singing vespers,\\nthe idea of writing the 'Decline and Fall' of the city first started to\\nhis mind.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Vatican\\n\\n\\nhas been the residence of the Popes since their return from Avignon, in\\nFrance, where they had resided from 1309 to 1377. It is now the most\\nextensive palace in the world, being three stories high and 1,151 feet\\nlong by 767 feet wide, covering over 20 acres! The palace comprises 20\\ncourts, eight grand staircases and two hundred smaller ones, and is said\\nto contain 11,000 halls, chapels, saloons and private apartments. Since\\nthe Italian occupation, Pope Pius IX. considers himself a prisoner in his\\nown palace, though strange to say, there are no doors locked except those\\nwhich he locks himself on the inside! King Victor Emanuel, though,\\nexcommunicated by the Pope in the most indecent language that ever fell\\nfrom human lips, has done no violence to the person of the Pope, and now\\ncontents himself as an outsider of the church.\\n\\nThe masses can now no longer \\\"go to Rome to see the Pope,\\\" for he neither\\nventures forth from his palace into the city for exercise and pleasure, as\\nhe used to, neither does he hold any public receptions. My French\\ncompanion who had come to Rome for the purpose of making a present of\\nseveral hundred dollars to the Pope, insisted on my accompanying him, as\\nhe was allowed a private interview, but I could not avail myself of the\\nopportunity.\\n\\nThe galleries and museums of the palace are the richest in the world, in\\nRoman and Christian antiquities. Here are the paintings which have\\nrendered Raphael and Angelo immortal to fame. They are almost innumerable.\\nThese masters translated the Bible into pictures, and here are the\\noriginals of many of the cuts that adorn our finely illustrated family\\nBibles. Michael Angelo painted 22 months (1508-11) at the ceiling of the\\nSixtine Chapel. In the Loggie, Raphael represents God in the person of an\\nold man wearing a long gray beard and attired in the oriental costume.\\n\\n\\n\\nMuseums.\\n\\n\\nThe principal museums in Rome are the Christian and the Gregorianum\\nLateranense in the Lateran; the Etruscan, the Egyptian and the Museum of\\nChristian Antiquities in the Vatican; and the Capitoline Museum, on\\nCapitoline Hill. The vast stores of ancient art contained in these, brings\\nthe beholder back again to the strange scenes of the distant past, as do\\nperhaps no other museums in the world. To do justice to these collections\\nwould require many weeks, and a mere catalogue of their contents would\\ncover many pages. Among the most interesting apartments of the Capitoline\\nMuseum, are the Room of the Dying Gladiator, the Room of the Philosophers,\\nthe Room of the Busts of the Emperors, the Room of Venus, &c. Baedeker\\nguides the tourist through Rome by means of 312 pages of description in\\nfine print. It may be proper to observe here, that Murray leads the\\nvisitor in the same way through London by means of a guide-book of 316\\npages, and Galignani has 438 pages on Paris, exclusive of the tables of\\ncontents.\\n\\nIn regard to the brilliant and magnificent churches of Italy, which, for\\nbeauty, throw those of the rest of the world into the shade, I will here\\nadd that their overawing grandeur assisted materially in making man a\\nhumble and submissive being; and possibly taught him to take the first\\nsteps from ancient barbarity toward civilization and refinement.\\n\\nSeveral square miles of ancient Rome lying in ruins, is now unoccupied,\\nand many of the roads which intersect this desolate area are lined on both\\nsides by walls from 7 to 10 or 12 feet in height. They are plastered white\\nand overgrown by the ivy; and as one walks along in these, he may well\\noccupy his time in watching a species of little reptiles that are very\\nnimble but shy, running up the high smooth walls as easily as along the\\nground. They are harmless, no doubt, but I dreaded them quite as much as\\nif I had been in a similar danger of treading upon snakes! They dart like\\narrows across the streets, and in their reckless haste of attempting to\\ncross the street to avoid me, they frequently came near losing their lives\\nunder my feet! They are about 3 to 6 inches long, we will say; have four\\nlegs as near as I could count, and are very slim, resembling the snake in\\nform and the frog in features. Good-by, Old Rome!\\n\\nI spent 8 days in London, 17 in Paris and 6 in Rome; doing to one city\\nabout as much justice as to the other, in those various periods of time;\\nbut if one would come to Rome first, he would not be able to tear himself\\naway in less than a few weeks. No one should travel any other way than\\n_against_ the course of civilization, on his first visit to Europe. In my\\ncourse from Liverpool to Rome I enjoyed new sights in a constant flow,\\nlike that of a steady rain. I do not believe that it would be well for an\\nAmerican to be abruptly transported to Rome and awake one morning there.\\nThe strange sights would assail him suddenly, like a flood of angry\\nwaters!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIX.\\n\\nRome to Brindisi.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom Rome I went to Pompeii, stopping long enough at Naples, however, to\\nlearn that the impudence of the pestiferous porters is quite unendurable.\\nItaly throughout is much infested with porters, but in the southern\\nsection of the peninsula they are a regular pest, which at times becomes\\nepidemic. During the traveling season it seems as if everybody was a\\nporter. Sometimes they will surround the traveler and assail him on every\\nside, asking him to let them carry his baggage. Sometimes I found them to\\nbe of great service in finding hotels for me, but at other times I was\\nmuch inconvenienced by their attacks. I think it was at Naples, where a\\ndozen or more of them yelled at me all at the same time, each desirous of\\ncarrying my satchel. As none of them could speak in a language that I\\nunderstood, I declined to let any one have it. Each one evinced his\\nearnestness by taking hold of my baggage while asking for it. After taking\\nturns at their chances in this way for a while, at the same time crowding\\nthe path in front of me so that I could not proceed, one of them in his\\ngreediness almost tore my satchel out of my hands, I responded to his\\nsupplication with such a tremendous no, that the next fellow assumed a\\nstooping posture and asked me in a whisper! These people deserve our pity\\nrather than censure. Many of them are evidently sometimes in a famishing\\ncondition. But few who have not seen, can form an idea of the poverty\\nwhich reigns in some sections of Southern Italy, especially between Naples\\nand Brindisi. I saw children running about in this section, that had\\nlittle of clothing save a shirt, which was generally torn in every part;\\nsome few, below the age of about six or eight years, had not even a thread\\nof clothing upon their bodies. An elderly man that was plowing with a pair\\nof oxen, as is the custom in Italy, was accompanied by his wife who was\\nwell dressed, but he wore only a shirt that reached to his knees, and a\\nhat. I spent a Sunday at Brindisi, and observed that people keep no Sunday\\nthere. All the people wear old and tattered garments, and I could not see\\na hat, a coat or a pair of pantaloons on the person of one of the hundreds\\nthat thronged the market-place all Sunday, that looked as if it had been\\nnew at any time within the last few years!\\n\\nThe railroad tunnels are even more numerous than in the Black Forest. In\\nsome places it becomes impossible to read in the cars, as the train is\\nmuch of the time under the mountains. From the window of the cars I saw a\\nman with his bare feet in a tub treading grapes, for the purpose of making\\nwine. It reminded me of the way, as it is said, some made their sourcrout\\nin this country some forty-five or fifty years ago.\\n\\nI spent a day among the ruins of Pompeii and in the ascent of Mount\\nVesuvius. Pompeii was a town of about 30,000 inhabitants when it was\\ndestroyed by an eruption of old Vesuvius in A.D. 79. On the 24th of August\\na dense shower of ashes covered the town 3 feet in thickness, but allowed\\nthe inhabitants time to escape. Only of those which returned to recover\\nvaluables, &c., were overtaken and covered by the shower of red hot\\nrapilli, or fragments of pumice-stone, which, with succeeding showers of\\nashes, covered the town to the depth of 7-8 feet. \\\"The present\\nsuperincumbent mass is about 20 feet in thickness.\\\" In the one third of\\nthe town already excavated the skeletons of some 500 have been found.\\nCasts of bodies found in 1863, were made by pouring plaster of Paris into\\nthe cavities where they had lain, and the figures of the deceased in their\\ndeath-struggle are thus obtained. B\\u00e6deker devotes 25 pages to a\\ndescription of the wonders and curiosities of this exhumed town.\\n\\nThe ascent of Vesuvius required about six hours. We started at 6:30 in the\\nmorning and returned at 12:30 p.m. The distance from Pompeii, which stands\\nat its foot, to the top of it is about 5 miles in a straight line, and\\neight miles by the paths. Mules can ascend half-way; but I took a guide\\nand walked the whole distance. At the point where the mules must be\\nabandoned, a number of guides offered to carry me up, or to drag me up by\\nmeans of a rope! But I climbed it. A cloud hangs over it all the time,\\nwhich is occasioned by the column of steam that issues from its crater.\\nThe entire upper part of the peak is perfectly bare of vegetation, and\\ncovered with fine cinders, rapilli, &c., through which escapes a gas that\\nalmost suffocates the ascending traveler. At the top we shouted into the\\ncrater and heard distinct echos after two seconds, which proves that the\\nmouth of the crater reflected the sound at the depth of about 1,000 or\\n1,100 feet!\\n\\nFrom Pompeii I returned to Naples and spent the night there. Early on\\nThursday morning I went to the \\\"Stazione\\\" (Station) and left for Brindisi.\\nThe temperature was 90 degrees in the shade, in the afternoon. Some people\\nhave constructed artificial caves which they use as stables, for their\\ncattle; and possibly some have such rude grottos for their homes!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XX.\\n\\nOn the Mediterranean.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Monday morning, September 26th, at 4:00 o'clock a.m., I stepped on\\nboard the steamship \\\"Avoca\\\" to take passage for Alexandria. Brindisi, like\\nHavre, is one of the finest places in the world to leave! Almost\\neverything about it is repulsive. I saw many children there that have\\npossibly never seen a washing day in their lives! I sailed for Egypt with\\ngreat reluctance, for I had already my misgivings about the property of\\ntourists from civilized nations going thither for sight-seeing. Well one\\ndoes see sights there--but, _such sights_!\\n\\nOur voyage to Egypt was a very prosperous and, I may say, a pleasant one.\\nTime, some eighty hours. As first and second class passage is unreasonably\\nhigh, boarding costing $9--$10 per day, I took third class passage, and\\nwith a special outlay of a few dollars obtained acceptable meals. The\\nsteamer belonged to an English line, and it was one of the most pleasant\\nincidents of my entire tour, to hear a company of sailors chime in one\\nevening and sing \\\"Kiss Me Mother, Kiss Your Darling.\\\" I had heard little\\nEnglish speaking for months, and now to hear that old familiar tune, five\\nthousand miles away from home, made me feel as if America could after all\\nnot be so very far off! There were no storms, nor was their any cool\\nnight air upon that \\\"summer seat.\\\" I slept one night on deck, without even\\nan awning of canvass over me,--how pleasant it was at night to awake and\\nsee the winter constellation of Orion as high up already in September, as\\nI was wont to see it in America in the month of January! We reached\\n\\n\\n\\nAlexandria\\n\\n\\non the fourth day after leaving the coasts of Italy. Perhaps I can not\\ngive the reader a better idea of what a blank Egypt seems to one who has\\nluxuriated for months amid the scenes of Europe, than by leaving my\\nchapter on Egypt a blank one. A great deal too much has been written about\\nEgypt and the East, already. What profitable example can we take from\\nthose semi-barbarians? A young man who was just returning from a tour\\nthrough Egypt and Greece, had told me already at Rome, that \\\"going to see\\nthe East is done mostly for the name of having done the thing.\\\" He had\\nbeen disappointed, and so was I. Why do tourists speak so much about the\\npyramids, after returning from Egypt? Because there is little else to be\\nseen there or to talk about! And these are not half the wonders that many\\nimagine who falsely presume that the building of the entire structures\\nwere undertaken at once. The broad foundation of 13 acres, which\\nconstitutes the base of the greatest, was not undertaken at one time; but\\nonly a small pyramid was at first reared, and around this, as a nucleus,\\nwas built layer after layer, until the structure assumed the amazing\\nproportions which now characterize the astounding magnificence of the\\ngreat pyramids on the plains of Geezeh. Thus at whatever time the\\nsovereign might die, his pyramid would be almost complete, and would be\\nlarge or small, in proportion to the time spent upon it. Perhaps\\nsucceeding generations built at some of the larger pyramids. They are\\nmonuments erected to the memory of kings or ruling families, and contain\\ntheir tombs. Such, at least, is a plausible solution of the problem of\\npyramid-building.\\n\\n\\n\\nCairo.\\n\\n\\nAt Cairo I engaged a guide whom I paid three dollars for accompanying me\\nas many hours, and bargained with him that he must furnish the mules, (or\\ndonkeys I should have said), and pay all the contingent expenses. We\\nvisited the Mosk of Mohamet Ali in the Citadel, the Mosk of Hassen and\\nothers. Attendants at the doors provided us with slippers, for no one is\\nallowed to tread the fine carpet (or matting?) of these holy temples with\\nhis shoes. Hats must be kept on, however. A large mosque generally\\nconsists of porticoes surrounded a square open court, containing a\\nfountain or tank in the center. Here every Mussulman washes his hands and\\nfeet before he goes to prayers. They sometimes would here bathe their\\nwhole bodies in former times! It is not at all surprising that washing of\\nfeet should have become a part of the religious ceremonies in countries\\nlike Egypt, where washing is quite as necessary to existence, as eating\\nand drinking, even. I wish they had pure water enough to wash themselves a\\ndozen times a day. They would certainly be, what we consider very dirty,\\nmore than half the time, even then. As it is, they must take their\\nuntanned goat-skin bags and collect the luke-warm water which they find in\\ndirty pools, and take it home for drinking purposes! It is impossible for\\nthe poor Egyptians to keep themselves clean. It rains only about three\\ndays in a year, and the wind takes so much dust into the air that one can\\noften neither see or breath for a few seconds. This dust collected in such\\na thick layer upon my body, the first day, that I could in the evening\\nplow furrows with my fingers upon any portion of my skin. I protected my\\neyes, by hiding my face in my shawl, during the most dangerous busts; but\\nbeing ignorant of the necessity of putting cotton into my ears, I lost the\\nhearing of one of them, which I only recovered quite lately. Hundreds of\\npeople in Cairo are blind, and certainly the majority of them have but\\npoor sight or have very sore eyes! What wretched houses they live in! Many\\nof the huts in their villages consist of but a single apartment, large\\nenough for a person to lie down lengthwise in it, but not more than 5 feet\\nwide. The walls and roof are all mud, and so low that a man cannot stand\\nerect in some of them! These mud-huts have no doors even! The men as well\\nas the women wear long flowing garments, like those represented in our\\npicture Bibles. Many of the poor women have but a single garment to cover\\ntheir bodies with. This consists of a hood-like covering for the head, and\\na loose flowing robe, all in one piece; having neither shoes nor the other\\ngarments to make themselves presentable in any decent or refined society.\\nMany present pictures of indescribable wretchedness. I saw a woman nurse\\nher child in the cars, who, when presented with an apple for her babe,\\nreturned her thanks _without a smile,_ even, to the giver! These people\\nare in too great misery to know what it is to feel happy! I saw men and\\nwomen speak by the hour in the train without once turning into any\\npleasant mood. How my pity might have turned into joy, could I only have\\nseen them indulge in a hearty laugh occasionally! Some of their girls and\\nwomen of all ages will still ride the donkey, after the oriental style.\\nThe middle and poorer classes of Egyptians will eat little snails and fish\\nfried with the heads, scales and all the appurtenances of their internal\\nstructures! In the East they churn the butter in bags made of untanned\\ngoat-skins, having the hair inside. Moreover, they bring the butter upon\\nthe table without doing so much as to comb it, even!\\n\\nWhen I had seen these things, and was informed that on account of the\\ncholera which was still raging in Syria, the surrounding nations had\\ninterposed a quarantine, so that if I would venture to go on to Joppa\\n(which I could have reached in a few hours), I would become a prisoner, I\\nsoon decided that I would rather not see a people (the Syrians) that is\\nmore miserable than the Egyptians, even, than be in danger of being\\nobliged to partake of food that could scarcely have failed to make me\\nsick. Crossing the desert by rail, meeting large caravans of camels, and\\nseeing the palm-trees, the minarets, the mosks, the pyramids, the muddy\\nwaters of the Nile, and above all the curious styles of the oriental\\ncostume, are interesting enough to one that comes to Egypt with ordinary\\nexpectations and correct information in regard to the country; but I did\\nnot expect to find the Egyptians a black inferior race, that would fight\\nwith each other on the pavements in the largest cities in broad daylight,\\nviolently tear my property out of my hands in sight of the finest square\\nin Alexandria, carry naked children upon their shoulders in their large\\ntowns, and seat themselves around large dishes of rice and gravy mixing\\nthe same with their fingers and conveying it to their mouths in the palms\\nof their hands! Numbers of them will dine without the use of either\\nknives, forks or spoons, and when dinner is over, there is but one dish to\\nbe washed. Each has two hands and ten fingers to clean, and washing those,\\nends the whole matter! These are extreme cases, of course. Some live\\ndecently, too. Some _few_ of the ruling classes, in luxury, perhaps. From\\nCairo I traveled by rail to Ismalia, thence by the Suez Canal to Port\\nSaid, where I spent the Sunday (October 3rd). On Tuesday I reached\\nAlexandria again. I there put up at a first-class hotel (for travelers\\nfrom civilized and refined nations can not enjoy themselves at inferior\\nhotels in Egypt), and stayed five days, until the next steamer sailed for\\nBrindisi. The hotel contained an excellent cafe, where ten intelligent and\\nrefined ladies and four gentlemen, all natives of Austria, were engaged to\\nrender music every evening for a whole year. One evening as I sat in the\\ncafe at my supper, a poor boy came in to sell flowers; for what we must\\npay in this country for a drink, I bought a bouquet almost as large as a\\nbucket, and when the next lady came to collect for the music, I gave her\\nthe bouquet as a present to the whole company. It was worth more than an\\nintroduction to the entire party, and for the balance of my stay I was\\nalways well entertained, and was kindly informed of anything that I asked\\nin regard to the manners and customs of oriental life. The people of every\\nnation under the sun, travel in Egypt in the habits of their own peculiar\\nnational costumes--the Turk with his turban, the Greek with his red cap,\\nand the Arabians, East Indians, Russians, and all the nations of Western\\nEurope are represented here, all wearing their own peculiar styles and\\nfashions. The money too is a mixture of the coins of a dozen different\\ncountries. None except the poorest women will come out of their houses\\nwithout having their faces covered with thick black veils.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the \\\"Home-Stretch.\\\"\\n\\n\\nI do not know where I was the happiest, when I reached the coasts of Italy\\nand saw dear Europe again, when I reached Paris, or when I landed at New\\nYork and was finally again ushered into the sweet scenes of home! But I\\nremember well that I left no city with so much regret as Paris. How I\\nwatched to see the last glimmering rays of its ten thousand gas-jets, as\\nour train moved away at the silent midnight hour of October 22nd.\\n\\nI had stopped at Milan to see the grand peagent of Emperor William of\\nGermany, and King Victor Emanuel of Italy, with a retinue of some 22,000\\nmilitia, with which they held a military drill, and saw the illumination\\nof the Cathedral on that memorable occasion; besides I had stopped a day\\nat Rome, and two at Paris; yet I made my return trip from Alexandria to\\nNew York in 25 days, sleeping but 7 nights in comfortable beds in all that\\ntime. Sleeping in the cars and on the ships, never amounted to much. I\\nmade this haste on account of the now rapidly approaching winter.\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion.\\n\\n\\nNotwithstanding the influence which the church and the political powers of\\nRome, in earlier times, and which Paris and the spirit of progress in\\nlater years, have exerted to the contrary, the manners, customs and\\ninstitutions of the people are still so different that the people of the\\nWestern Continent can not form correct ideas of European life without\\nhaving first visited portions of it. For want of a standard of comparison,\\nthe reader is often utterly deceived by fine poetical descriptions,\\nbecause he can not properly construe the language.\\n\\nA tour of ordinary length and duration can now be made through the western\\nnations of Europe, with less expense than is generally believed, as may be\\ninferred from the fact that my entire tour of nearly fourteen thousand\\nmiles, cost less than seven hundred dollars. Many travelers lose forty\\npercent of their money by imposition, and others are more careless and\\nextravagant than they ought. If I could not have spoken German, it would\\nhave cost me several hundred dollars more. Could I have spoken French, it\\nmight have cost me a hundred dollars less. The expenses of making the tour\\nof England, France and Switzerland are from $300 to $1,000, according to\\nthe style in which one wishes to travel; but a young man who wishes to\\nspent $1,000 in educating himself, will make the best investment by\\nspending half of it in traveling in foreign lands. He will there lay such\\na sure foundation for a correct knowledge of the institutions of the\\nworld, as no amount of reading can ever afford him. Let the enterprising\\n\\\"go west,\\\" but the student should see eastern countries.\\n\\n\\nThe End.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
